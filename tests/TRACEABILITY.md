# Acceptance traceability

Current criterion IDs use `REQ-QML-`; completion increments use `INC-QML-`.
[Legacy aliases](../docs/qt-qml/IDENTIFIERS.md) retain earlier evidence identity.
Recorded test identities retain their historical evidence; current renamed viewer
tests are mapped to their actual functions below. Source annotations keep their IDs.

The current catalog contains twenty-one requirements and eighty-five stable
acceptance criteria. REQ-QML-018 has seven criteria, including the separate AC07
header-dispatch contract; REQ-QML-019/020/021 retain four/three/three criteria.
INC-QML-00–07 hosted proof describes its original seventeen-requirement,
sixty-eight-criterion profile. Subsequent evidence does not retroactively broaden
those historical results.

INC-QML-11/15/08a/b/c and INC-QML-28–38 have current local source, update, consumer
and reviewed installed-wheel evidence. All seven REQ-QML-018 criteria are locally
verified for the bounded Windows x64/Python 3.12 profile. Individual assignments
and the [final local matrix](#final-adoption-delivery) distinguish passing cases
from wider platform, native interaction, live-service and runtime limitations.
The recorded full source run has 59 baseline failures and 178 skips, with no added
failure identities; full typing remains a failed baseline gate. The later
[Windows dependency follow-up](../docs/qt-qml/VALIDATION.md#windows-shell-and-optional-dependency-follow-up--2026-10-04)
clears 40 of those 59 in a selective rerun, retains 19, and exposes two previously
skipped hook portability assertions. It does not replace full-suite evidence.
Neither aggregate test totals nor skipped cases establish acceptance.

The separate [shared compatibility verification](#shared-compatibility-verification)
records `REQ-CORE-` behavior and the all-extras environment. The recorded native
Windows full run at `463ca32` has 8,818 passes, zero failures and 151 skips. Separate unchanged-
source profiles pass all 76 Node and seven preprocessor/wheel cases previously
skipped for setup. Later real Linux/service and native checks pass at the
[verified integrated checkpoint](#verified-integrated-hosted-checkpoint--8b6c9d2). The
59-failure run above is historical; its failure identities are cleared in the
current applicable Windows profile. Full typing still fails on existing errors.

The chronological records below preserve checkpoint evidence. Their older pending
statements, epochs and test totals describe the recorded revisions. Current status
and proof are in the [verified integrated checkpoint](#verified-integrated-hosted-checkpoint--8b6c9d2),
with earlier adoption evidence retained in
[validation](../docs/qt-qml/VALIDATION.md#final-adoption-delivery).
See [implementation limits](../docs/qt-qml/IMPLEMENTATION.md#final-adoption-delivery),
[export contracts](../docs/qt-qml/EXPORT_MATRIX.md) and
[platform matrix](../docs/qt-qml/PLATFORM_MATRIX.md).

## Shared compatibility verification

The Windows x64/Python 3.12 checkpoint installs all extras from the unchanged
lock with `uv sync --all-extras --frozen`; `uv pip check` reports 197 compatible
packages. Tree-sitter remains 0.25.2, HCL 1.2.0 and language-pack 0.11.0.
The [compatibility plan](../docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) records profile setup, exact
remaining system procedure, ownership, size ceilings and consumer limitations.

Synthetic length cases establish admission/retention, not a real long-path launch. Actual Codex event delivery and other PowerShell versions remain separate system gaps. |
| REQ-CORE-002-AC01 | `tests/test_filesystem_profiles.py::test_req_core_002_ac01_detect_rejects_nonregular_stat_modes`; `tests/test_filesystem_profiles.py::test_req_core_002_ac01_stat_failures_are_unreadable`; original real fixtures in `tests/test_non_regular_files.py` | Native admission/error seams and hosted real FIFO/socket cases pass at the verified 10cb15a checkpoint below; privileged device/link fixtures retain explicit capability exclusions |

| REQ-CORE-002-AC03 | `tests/test_filesystem_profiles.py::test_req_core_002_ac03_unavailable_cwd_reports_root_reason` | Missing-root/chdir-denied assertions failed before correction; all three safe diagnostic categories pass after correction |
| REQ-CORE-003-AC01 | `tests/test_terraform_modules.py::test_same_named_directories_and_cross_file_references_stay_separate` | Both LF/CRLF cases pass exact four identities/references and exclude cross-directory targets |
| REQ-CORE-003-AC02 | `tests/test_terraform_modules.py::test_same_named_directories_and_cross_file_references_stay_separate`; `tests/test_terraform_modules.py::test_raw_extractor_scopes_ids_by_full_directory` | Production extraction, directed build and JSON reload pass portable paths, locations and scope; Terraform production unchanged |

Focused commands and results at the checkpoint:

- Final INC-CORE-05 consumer correction: `PYTHONUTF8=1 python -X utf8 -m pytest tests/test_codex_hook_execution.py -q --tb=short -p no:cacheprovider` passes 19 cases, with no skips and one existing Hypothesis discovery warning. Both actual Windows shells exercise the persisted command. Installer/settings-merge/hook characterization passes 143 cases with three existing profile skips; these selections overlap and are not added to the full-suite count.
- `pytest tests/test_install.py tests/test_install_references.py tests/test_install_roundtrip.py tests/test_skill_auto_refresh.py tests/test_uninstall_scope.py tests/test_codex_hook_execution.py -q`: 243 passed, five native symlink skips. Strengthened exact-launcher/subcommand follow-up: two passed.
- `pytest tests/test_hooks.py tests/test_skillgen_input_path_injection.py -q`: 143 passed, eight pre-existing profile skips. The final affected selection plus shell-identity helpers: 37 passed, no skips. All 20 hostile-path cases include reachable unsafe controls.
- `pytest tests/test_watch.py tests/test_non_regular_files.py tests/test_filesystem_profiles.py -q`: 198 passed, eleven profile/capability skips, one existing Hypothesis warning. Seven formerly failing impossible Windows fixtures now remain explicit system gaps; sixteen new portable cases pass.
- `pytest tests/test_terraform.py tests/test_terraform_modules.py tests/test_extractors_registry.py::test_terraform_migrated -q`: 42 passed, one unavailable symlink skip, one existing Hypothesis warning.
- `ruff check .`: passed. `python -m tools.skillgen --check`: all 134 artifacts match. Lockfile unchanged. Full native source and refreshed installed-wheel evidence supersedes the restart gap in the current record below; actual Linux execution remains pending.

These selections overlap and are not added into a full-suite total. Real filesystem
capability assertions, native hook consumer execution and live-service tests remain
separate from contract profiles and fake-provider boundaries. Full typing is a
separate gate and is not established by Ruff or selected tests.

### Current native source and artifact evidence — 2026-10-05

Frozen source: `463ca3226c4aec4390a1e931fb1be1582059d1ca`, Windows x64,
Python 3.12.14, all 197 locked source-environment distributions. The full source
command is the isolated driver's `pytest tests/ -q --tb=short -p no:cacheprovider
-rs --junitxml=<evidence>/full.xml`, using the explicit environment Python with
`-I -X utf8` and canonical source imports. The profile exposes portable Git
Bash/sh and a literal Python forwarding shim, isolates provider/home/install
state and disables installation fallback. Pytest returns zero: **8,818 passed,
zero failures/errors, 151 skipped, 20 warnings**, with 1,143.29 seconds wall time.

The original restricted PATH excluded the already installed Node and GNU C
preprocessor, and the reviewed-wheel variable was absent. Supplemental profiles
retain that same source/dependency revision and execute exact skipped IDs:

- Node 24.19.0: **76 passed**, zero failures/skips, 26.42 seconds.
- GNU `cpp` 13.1.0 and reviewed wheel input: **four Fortran preprocessor and three wheel cases passed**, zero failures/skips, 4.68 seconds. This compiler is a test oracle; Graphify analysis gains no compiler or Qt SDK runtime dependency.

The full-run counts are retained without adding these separate profiles. The
remaining 68 distinct initial skips are 63 Windows/POSIX capability or fixture
exclusions, two other-Python-version cases, one inapplicable obsolete bundle
fallback and two unavailable FalkorDB integration cases. Skips remain exclusions,
not passes. The hosted increment assigns applicable Linux/service cases explicitly.
The 20 warnings are nine clustering dependency warnings, seven Solidity parser
deprecations, two expected cache-rejection diagnostics, one Hypothesis collection
warning and one Starlette/httpx deprecation; no warning caused a failed assertion.

All three profiles retain HEAD, 667 Python-file fingerprints, source dependencies
and original coverage bytes. The canonical source-fingerprint map SHA-256 is
`36155c56557d2a52bb8384fa8964581de57cc22c9b5ec46703d0fb8f0916e291`.
Full Pyright 1.1.409 with the explicit source interpreter reports **604 errors,
zero warnings, 663 files**, exit one. Compared with immutable source `135d50b`
under the same dependencies/configuration, all 604 diagnostic identities match:
zero added and zero removed. The typing gate remains failed.

Reviewed wheel SHA-256:
`057c509296b9f6e25be1dd39b72f3d463f10cdccfb7a0b95836f510f016dd518`.
All 180 packaged Python payloads match current source bytes. Relative to the
earlier reviewed 179-module wheel, 102 differences are only LF/CRLF spelling;
newline-normalized source and parsed syntax differ only in `install.py`,
`watch.py` and the new `codex_hook_command.py`. Independent installed consumption
pins all Graphify imports to its 163-distribution runtime from a neutral directory:
**35 hook/filesystem cases pass**, with zero failures/skips. `uv pip check`
confirms compatibility. This is complementary installed-consumer evidence,
not a replacement for the earlier Qt/QML artifact matrix or a hosted result.

### Hosted acceptance assignments

The CI implementation and exact hosted execution remain separately reviewable.
Each job's JUnit artifact and GitHub conclusion must be read for the same tested
source/configuration revision; configuration validation alone cannot pass these
criteria. [Hosted procedure](../docs/COMPATIBILITY.md#hosted-runner-proof-procedure)
owns setup, revision identity, exclusions and recovery.

| Acceptance ID | Exact automated job/system assignment | Current evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC01 | `.github/workflows/ci.yml::test` four Python lanes; actual fixtures in `tests/test_non_regular_files.py`, `tests/test_cpp_preprocess.py`, `tests/test_qml_wheel_artifact.py`, `tests/test_falkordb_integration.py` | Hosted `10cb15a`: all four full jobs pass; required Linux/service/wheel regressions and exact corrected cleanup case individually pass. Explicit platform/baseline skips retain their assignments |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC02 | `.github/workflows/ci.yml::windows-compatibility`; exact CORE functions above and assigned HTML/installer/shell modules | Hosted `10cb15a`: 836 passes, 21 explicit skips, zero failures. All original shell failures and revised admission cases individually pass with retained consumer identity proof |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC03 | Source identity/readiness, pytest, retention, service cleanup and artifact steps in both CI source profiles; GitHub run/job/artifact read for actual checkout | Hosted `10cb15a`: all five API-digest-verified source archives retain identity/JUnit/integrity; native report includes exact two-shell consumer identities. Four real services/test graphs are confirmed removed |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC04 | CI trigger/permission/concurrency configuration review and hosted procedure's PR/recovery event audit | Normal PR events own both workflows; no duplicate dispatch. All four `10cb15a` source lanes finish successfully; earlier matrix cancellations remain historical incomplete evidence |

Local configuration review parses both workflows with PyYAML `BaseLoader`,
compiles each embedded Python block, checks extracted Ubuntu scripts with
`bash -n`, and parses the Windows script through PowerShell's
`System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser.ParseFile`. The CI workflow is
449 physical lines within its documented 450-line cohesion ceiling. Existing
triggers, Ubuntu matrix, skill-generation/security jobs and QML-wheel matrix/job
selection remain intact. Both workflow concurrency groups now use distinct run
IDs outside PR events. These are local configuration results, not hosted passes.

At first publication `3b005d3`, the delivery changes only CI and documentation
after the completed native run: all 667 Python-file fingerprints and 197 dependency versions match the
tested source, and original coverage bytes are preserved. `ruff check .` passes,
`python -m tools.skillgen --check` matches all 134 artifacts, and the document
check resolves every acceptance criterion and exact test reference. The graph
refresh is AST-only navigation maintenance, not additional acceptance evidence.

The first hosted source head `3b005d3` produced
[CI admission failure 37244260265](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37244260265)
before creating any jobs: job-level `env` cannot reference `runner.temp`.
Resolving the evidence directory inside each Ubuntu script from `RUNNER_TEMP`
preserves the same artifact location and also admits the independent cleanup
step after failed setup. Official checksum-verified actionlint 1.7.12 rejects
the original configuration with that context error and accepts both corrected
workflows with zero diagnostics, without suppressions. This semantic check
complements YAML/Python/native shell syntax; ShellCheck and Pyflakes were not
installed for the actionlint run. No Linux/service pass is inferred from the
admission failure or local correction.

At the same source head,
[QML wheel run 37244275402](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37244275402)
passes all four Ubuntu artifact lanes but fails the installed native-module
smoke assertion in all four Windows and all four macOS lanes. These are current
failed gates under investigation, not skips or passing platform acceptance.

### Canonical accepted-input identity — INC-QML-39

The first hosted smoke failure is reproduced locally with a real Windows
short-path alias. Canonical spelling passes; the unchanged installed smoke
fails through the shortened spelling before the correction. The membership
boundary now compares canonical contained input identity against the accepted
declaration. Stored lexical provenance, literal lookup, Qt policy 18 and AST
schema 12 retain their contracts. This local reproduction explains the Windows
failure; matching macOS temporary-directory aliases remain a hypothesis until
the corrected hosted lane passes.

| Acceptance ID | Exact automatically collected assignment | Evidence and limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-QML-020-AC01 | `tests/test_qt_project_membership_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_real_parent_alias_preserves_smoke_and_cold_warm_identity` | Unchanged native smoke, canonical/alias/reanchored identity, immutable source bytes and warm unrelated Python cache; real Windows short path passes, portable parent symlink requires host capability |
| REQ-QML-020-AC02 | `tests/test_qt_project_membership_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_path_alias_cannot_authorize_foreign_source`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_input_resolution_failure_is_bounded_and_preserves_facts`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_conflicting_transport_retains_durable_products_and_recovers` | Outside-root/conflicting input and OSError/RuntimeError reject boundedly without changing facts; real manual/watch publication preserves graph, manifest, stamp and root marker, then recovers and repeats |
| REQ-QML-020-AC03 | `tests/test_qt_project_membership_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_alias_updates_remove_stale_membership_and_match_full_rebuild` | Real manual/watch build-declaration removal retires its stale site/edges, matches canonical full rebuild and repeats idempotently |

Before the production correction, the alias selection records five failures,
two passing rejection controls and seven unavailable-symlink skips. After the
correction, alias plus existing project-membership/lifecycle selections pass
48 cases with seven capability skips and one existing Hypothesis warning.
The seven skips are real directory-symlink capability exclusions on this Windows
host; they do not establish portable alias acceptance. The production owner is
198 physical lines; the new test module is 222, within the 300-line ceiling.
The frozen broader source selection passes 2,259 cases with nine capability
skips, two warnings and zero failures/errors in 527.19 seconds wall time. Its
command uses the isolated source interpreter with all `tests/test_qml_*.py` and
`tests/test_qt_*.py` files except the separately assigned wheel-artifact module,
then `-q --tb=short -p no:cacheprovider -rs --junitxml=REPORT`. All 668 Python-file
fingerprints, 197 dependencies and original coverage bytes remain unchanged;
the source-map digest is
`c2ad0bc662ab2780385766dd22fc56d0bf6a4f5cb059e4e960d61979b60878d4`.
The nine skips are the seven new and two pre-existing real-symlink exclusions.
The two warnings are existing Hypothesis collection and Starlette/httpx notices.
This selection overlaps earlier runs and is not added to their totals.

Fresh wheel SHA-256
`f6a3c7befa8cae62ef70a6d89649b64cdc409fb25056d2ee383166c7fe8be522`
contains 180 Python payloads identical to source, changing only the membership
owner relative to the preceding core-05 wheel. Ordinary QML and core-only smoke
pass in clean constrained installed environments; every loaded production module
comes from the independent installation. A near-root real Windows temporary
short alias fails with `QT_CPP_LIMIT`: shared facade normalization publishes
traversal source provenance for contained C++ files. The same case fails in fresh
source with and without the offline guard. INC-QML-40 owns this separate defect;
the native traversal rejection is correct and is retained. Complete installed
alias acceptance and corrected hosted proof remain outstanding.
Existing REQ-QML-004-AC04 and
REQ-QML-012-AC01/AC02 containment/failure assignments remain applicable; no
new corpus reader, persistence owner or diagnostic code is introduced.

On the frozen 198/222-line production/test payload, Ruff 0.15.14 passes and
targeted Pyright 1.1.409 reports zero errors/warnings. A fresh whole-project
comparison uses the same Python 3.12.14, 197 dependencies and typing configuration
for current source and immutable `135d50b`: both report 604 errors, zero warnings,
with exactly 604 shared diagnostic identities and zero added/removed. Current
source analyzes 664 files in 24.022 seconds; baseline analyzes 658 in 22.615.
Both whole-project commands exit one. The expanded alias coverage adds no typing
diagnostic; it does not pass the existing whole-project typing gate.

The failure-boundary review separately reproduces persistent OSError and
RuntimeError at the accepted CMake input after source/index creation, through
direct joins and manual/watch writers. Diagnostic construction resolves the
failed input again and rethrows its raw body, leaving later sources unannotated.
Manual exits one and watch returns false; graph/manifest/stamp/root-marker bytes,
repair and no-change repeat pass. The six opt-in probes fail the bounded-body
acceptance assertion. INC-QML-41 owns ordinary regression promotion and correction
for REQ-QML-012-AC01/AC02 and REQ-QML-020-AC02. This is a diagnostic gap; no data
loss is inferred.

### Canonical facade provenance — INC-QML-40

The owning normalization now decides containment from cached physical identity
before external fallback, preserving written/resolved endpoint key forms and
strict native traversal rejection. A nearby real alias is tested independently
of the older external helper's deep-path basename fallback. True external input
and a foreign implementation cannot become in-root membership/native authority.

| Acceptance ID | Exact automatically collected assignment | Local evidence and limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-QML-020-AC01 | `tests/test_qt_facade_path_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_nearby_alias_preserves_generic_cold_warm_provenance`; `tests/test_qt_facade_path_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_nearby_alias_preserves_unchanged_native_smoke_and_mixed_graph`; `tests/test_qt_facade_path_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_nearby_alias_preserves_real_decl_def_provenance` | Actual generic/Python/C++/QML source identity, CRLF bytes, canonical/alias cold/warm graphs and real declaration/definition carriers pass |

| REQ-QML-020-AC03 | `tests/test_qt_facade_path_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_nearby_alias_updates_retire_membership_and_generic_targets`; `tests/test_qt_alias_policy_upgrade.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_policy18_no_change_upgrade_retains_repairs_and_repeats` | Real manual/watch generic then metadata-only edits, stale target/site retirement, canonical full parity, unrelated Python identity and mixed/C++-only no-edit policy upgrades pass; failed candidate stamp publication retains the cohort and repair/repeat completes |

Original facade selection: four failed, one passed, five symlink skips.
Mixed and C++-only policy-upgrade selections each fail two cases under policy 18.
Final existing/new alias, policy and six unrelated source-portability/remap
modules pass **65 cases, zero failures/errors, fourteen symlink-capability skips**,
one existing Hypothesis warning, in 13.43 seconds. These selections overlap earlier
proof and are not added to full-suite totals. Policy 19 refreshes prior native/Qt
products at the same package/source version; AST schema 12 and persistence owners
are unchanged. Generic-only prior API products require an explicit forced rebuild.
The final 238/85-line test modules remain below 300; the facade's 8,997 lines stay
within its existing 9,010 ceiling. Current hosted alias/platform proof remains open.

### Failure-safe join diagnostics — INC-QML-41

Diagnostic context no longer rethrows a persistent input identity failure.
Guarded physical containment and lexical fallback are diagnostic-only; foreign,
unavailable, overlong, control and Unicode line/paragraph-separator labels use
an empty `source_file` string. Safe complete relative labels have a 160-character
ceiling and are never truncated into another apparent identity. Every affected
Qt/QML source retains the existing failure record; unrelated Python is untouched.

Focused RED: **nineteen failed, three passed, three symlink-capability skips**,
4.90 seconds. Corrected focused profile: **22 passed, zero failures/errors, three
capability skips**, 6.11 seconds. Existing failure/membership/update compatibility
uses the guarded canonical Python 3.12.14 with all 197 locked distributions:
**136 passed, zero failures/errors, ten symlink skips**, one existing Hypothesis
warning, 115.19 seconds. These profiles overlap earlier selections and are not
combined into a full-suite total. The changed helper covers seven of seven
measured statements and two of two measured branches. Overall pipeline coverage
is 89%; remaining uncovered collector/index-diagnostic paths are unchanged.
The original coverage file is preserved; coverage evidence uses isolated storage.
The production/test owners measure 106/190 lines, within the 300-line ceiling.

### Final local alias artifact and contribution gates

The combined frozen INC-QML-39/40/41 candidate is built from 671 source/test/tool
Python files with canonical source-map SHA-256
`795659a2a35b41b71443ad89e07ee739bef0242d67a0d82b0b41fb79f9ac822b`.
Reviewed wheel SHA-256:
`f2a759cc6ae5dd11d61a73806baebb867ebe4a1929cf06328b1d0473924a6799`.
All 180 packaged Python payloads match source bytes; only membership, facade,
derived policy and pipeline differ from the preceding core-05 wheel. Clean
constrained extra/core environments use 40/30 compatible distributions from the
unchanged 197-version source snapshot. Every loaded production module originates
in that independent installation (128 extra/122 core modules).

Unchanged offline `-I` QML/core smoke and the real Windows near-root temporary
short-alias native smoke pass from a neutral working directory. Three ordinary
reviewed-wheel metadata/import/parser-boundary tests also pass, with one existing
Hypothesis warning. Artifact proof takes 9.32 seconds; Python is 3.12.14,
tree-sitter 0.25.2, C++ grammar 0.23.4, language-pack 0.11.0 and watchdog 6.0.0.
Source/dependency and original coverage bytes are preserved. This current artifact
replaces the failed first alias candidate for its profile; hosted proof remains open.

The same fresh optional artifact executes the three ordinary alias, policy-upgrade
and failure-context modules through `python -I -X utf8`, importlib-mode pytest and
an offline process/network guard from a neutral directory: **33 passed, zero
failures/errors/warnings, ten actual symlink-capability skips**, 10.71 seconds.
All 152 loaded Graphify modules originate in the artifact; only the test namespace
is supplied by the source checkout. Its 180 payloads and 40 dependency versions,
the source's 197 dependencies and original coverage bytes remain unchanged.
The first harness attempt placed fixtures under the checkout's ignored `.venv`
and records eight initial-build setup failures. Moving only its owned fixture
directory to the host temporary area corrects setup without changing production,
tests or assertions; both attempts are retained. Capability skips do not establish
Linux/macOS acceptance and these overlapping selections are not added together.

Ruff 0.15.14 passes the whole repository and all eight touched/new Python files;
all 134 generated skill artifacts match. Actionlint 1.7.12 accepts both corrected
workflows without suppressions. Document checks resolve every acceptance ID and
exact test reference. AST-only graph maintenance is navigation, not acceptance.
Targeted Pyright 1.1.409 on all eight files has 120 existing facade errors, exactly
shared with immutable `135d50b`; the other seven files have zero diagnostics.
Whole-project Pyright has **604 errors, zero warnings, 667 files**, exit one,
20.990 seconds: 604 shared and zero added/removed under identical Python,
dependencies and configuration. Typing remains a failed baseline gate.

### Hosted Windows application selection — INC-CORE-07

At source `f95366d`, the native compatibility job fails before pytest because
Get-Command returns two Node applications and `.Source` projects both paths.
The job retains dependency/import evidence only; identity, pytest exit, JUnit
and post-test integrity are absent. No native test acceptance is inferred from
that setup failure. Node and uv selection now retains one first-PATH application.

| Acceptance ID | Exact ordinary regression | Evidence and limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC02 | `tests/test_ci_windows_tools.py::test_req_core004_ac02_workflow_executes_first_real_path_application` | Actual workflow expressions execute a copied preferred real Node/uv binary before the original; scalar path and Node process.execPath prove exact executable identity |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC03 | `tests/test_ci_windows_tools.py::test_req_core004_ac03_missing_workflow_application_has_no_fallback`; `tests/test_ci_windows_tools.py::test_req_core004_ac03_node_guard_rejects_real_incompatible_application` | Missing Node/uv and real uv named as Node reject through owning discovery/version expressions; no fake executable response or fallback |

Immutable historical workflow: **two failures, three passes**, 7.22 seconds.
Current workflow: **five passes, zero skips/failures/errors**, 13.38 seconds,
native Windows PowerShell 5.1, Node 24.19.0 and actual uv. The focused test is
109 physical lines; Ruff and whitespace checks pass. Original coverage bytes
are retained. Corrected hosted execution and its complete evidence remain pending.

### Native shell launch identity — INC-CORE-08

Hosted `38bf8cc` records 783 native passes, 33 failures and 20 skips. Its retained
artifact binds source/base/checkout, tools and unchanged 197 dependencies/source.
Ten hook and 23 skill input-security cases launch the WSL stub through a bare
Bash process name. A real direct probe confirms that PATH lookup selects Git
Bash while native bare launch invokes another executable. Existing absolute
preflight therefore cannot establish the ordinary Python consumer's identity.

| Acceptance ID | Exact ordinary regression | Observable outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC02 | `tests/test_shell_portability_helpers.py::test_req_core004_ac02_admitted_shell_runs_real_posix_command` | Both selected absolute shells execute real POSIX syntax; no GNU-only assumption is imposed on POSIX |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC02 | `tests/test_shell_portability_helpers.py::test_req_core004_ac02_native_cwd_shadow_requires_explicit_path_admission` | A real native CWD decoy shadows bare launch; configured-PATH selection excludes it until CWD is explicitly admitted |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC02 | `tests/test_shell_portability_helpers.py::test_req_core004_ac02_real_consumers_resist_native_cwd_shadow` | Actual hook Bash/sh and skillgen launchers preserve the admitted process identity and original result assertions |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC03 | `tests/test_shell_portability_helpers.py::test_req_core004_ac03_missing_shell_selection_is_rejected`; `tests/test_shell_portability_helpers.py::test_req_core004_ac03_invalid_shell_identity_is_rejected`; `tests/test_shell_portability_helpers.py::test_req_core004_ac03_unadmitted_shell_name_is_rejected` | Missing/invalid identity or unadmitted names reject before launch without global/system fallback |

The unchanged original consumer functions fail three real decoy regressions;
fifteen helper cases pass. Corrected ordinary shell/hook/skillgen selection
passes **161 cases, eight explicit Windows/POSIX profile skips**, with all
eighteen helper cases passing. Raw literal payload, hostile-input rejection,
legitimate path, nonexistent path and vulnerable positive controls are retained.
No subprocess-resolution adapter changes the process under test.

The complete revised workflow consumer block executes before collection through
the same helper: both actual Git shells prove the selected Python interpreter
and Node 24.19.0 executable identity. Source (682 Python files), 197 dependencies
and original coverage remain unchanged during this proof; the owned forwarding
shim is removed. Shared helper/test files measure 56/161 lines, hooks retain
1,600 and skillgen 222. Both workflows pass actionlint 1.7.12; all extracted
Bash/Python blocks compile, and complete native blocks parse in Windows
PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh 7.6.6. CI measures 467 within its documented 470 ceiling.
These are local consumer/configuration results; corrected hosted proof remains
assigned to the next normal PR event.

### Native artifact report retention — INC-CORE-09

Acceptance: REQ-CORE-004-AC03. Real source `f699b0f` native job
`111592305005` passes **836 tests, 21 explicit platform/baseline skips**, zero
failures/errors/warnings. JUnit individually passes all eighteen CORE-08 helper
cases, the original 33 shell regressions, all seven CLI cases and five CORE-07
selection cases. Artifact `11321839435` archive SHA-256
`634462cf980eaa47090d2d64109702473d6142678ccb655bbb4a0f8db3a8f51f`
matches GitHub's API digest. Source/base/synthetic checkout, tool versions,
197 dependency identities, pytest exit and source integrity are retained.
The real archive omits the generated `shell-consumers.json`; exact per-consumer
identity transport therefore remains unavailable despite passing preflight.

The one-line artifact inclusion correction leaves producer/test behavior and
permissions unchanged. Its meaningful system regression is the actual GitHub
archive read and report/profile identity verification described in
[the acceptance procedure](../docs/COMPATIBILITY.md#native-consumer-evidence-retention--inc-core-09).
This is a real external publication boundary, not a simulated or literal-only
pytest test. Prepared configuration is not a retained-report pass. The corrected
normal PR event must provide exact source/base/checkout and archive/record proof
before AC03 is verified; current intended runs finish before publication.

### Hosted source and optional-wheel checkpoint — f699b0f

[CI 37255744156](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37255744156)
and [QML 37255744181](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37255744181)
are normal PR attempt-one runs. Source head
`f699b0feb760ff0fc6347b3930cf79fa0b4a615f`, base
`f61827f42378f6e7feff05a1cb4cbbcab1736ca8` and actual synthetic checkout
`114824c6099ce6592f7fd025a291b129681bb445` are bound through API parent inspection,
job logs and retained source identities. Both runs are terminal before the next
correction is published; no duplicate dispatch or job retry is introduced.

| Profile | Actual outcome | Evidence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 | Each 9,007 passed, 112 explicit skips, zero failures; end-to-end install passes | Full source suite, real disposable FalkorDB and reviewed source wheel |
| Ubuntu Python 3.10 | 9,007 passed, 111 explicit skips, one cleanup-fixture failure; end-to-end install step omitted after failure | `test_inc25_partial_setup_cleanup_fault_retains_safe_recovery_evidence` does not inject its intended unlink failure on this interpreter |
| Native Windows Python 3.12 | 836 passed, 21 explicit skips, zero failures/errors/warnings | JUnit/integrity/archive evidence above; consumer report omission remains INC-CORE-09 |
| Optional QML wheel, four Windows lanes | Each 2,323 passed, three optional-extra skips | Platform source selection and unchanged isolated installed QML/core smokes |
| Optional QML wheel, four macOS lanes | Each 2,271 passed, 55 Windows/optional-extra skips | Platform source selection and unchanged isolated installed QML/core smokes |
| Optional QML wheel, four Ubuntu lanes | Each three artifact tests passed, zero skips | Unchanged isolated installed QML/core smokes also pass |

All 39 assigned co-owner/remap/discovery/CLI source cases and the exact two live
FalkorDB plus three wheel cases individually pass on every Ubuntu lane. All four
downloaded archives match their API digests. Each 182-payload wheel matches the
reviewed source Git blobs; checkout, tracked inputs, dependencies and wheel bytes
remain unchanged. Both test graphs are deleted and all four owned containers are
confirmed absent. The service has no mounted storage, Redis 8.10.2 and module
60001; readiness includes actual graph-list/query operations. Source runner tools
are Node 22.23.3, GNU cpp 13.3.0, Bash 5.2.21 and Git 2.55.0 on Ubuntu image
20260927.320.1. Exact skip identities and per-case JUnit remain in retained source
artifacts; an aggregate count does not turn a skip into acceptance.

All twelve QML jobs pass, including all 24 installed smokes. Its platform suites
run from the checkout and do not establish isolated installed origin for every
case. That workflow retains no wheel-digest/JUnit artifact; logs supply selected
module outcomes, not a fabricated per-case attestation. Windows/macOS Python 3.10
each retain two existing warnings. Skill generation passes all five validators
and 134 generated artifacts. Advisory security remains green by policy while
Bandit reports four High/eight Medium/109 Low findings and completed pip-audit
reports nine unique package/advisory identities across three packages. Their
baseline origin is not assessed; this is not clean security acceptance. Local
Pyright still fails with 604 exact baseline errors and zero added/removed errors.

### Partial-setup cleanup fixture portability — INC-QML-48

Acceptance: REQ-QML-012-AC02 and REQ-QML-018-AC06. Ordinary collected regression:
`tests/test_publication.py::test_inc25_partial_setup_cleanup_fault_retains_safe_recovery_evidence`.
The actual hosted Python 3.10 case fails before correction; native Python 3.10.21
reproduces that failure against unchanged production/test bytes, while native
Python 3.12.14 passes. Runtime inspection confirms the cached accessor bypass.

The corrected scenario patches production's actual `Path.unlink` entry point,
delegates real removal outside the exact rejected owned recovery target, and
requires that target's observed fault. Existing `GRAPH_PUBLICATION_CLEANUP`, public
message redaction, four accepted-product bytes and durable old-graph snapshot
assertions remain intact. Production publication and diagnostics do not change;
no resolver/schema/cache evidence is invalidated by this fixture correction.
Corrected ordinary native execution uses:

```text
PYTHON -X utf8 -m pytest tests/test_publication.py tests/test_qt_product_publication.py tests/test_qt_readonly_publication.py tests/test_qt_publication_stub_origin.py -q -ra --tb=short -p no:cacheprovider --junitxml=REPORT.xml
```

Python 3.10.21/3.12.14/3.13.15/3.14.7 each pass **82 of 83 collected cases**, with
one explicit actual file-symlink capability skip and zero failures/errors. Each
includes all 32 publication cases and 51 adjacent Qt publication controls; the
corrected cleanup case individually passes without a skip. Source production
origin is verified. Dependency inventories (43/197/40/40 respectively), production
and selected test bytes, original coverage and checkpoint HEAD remain unchanged
through the run. A separate byte-exact `f699b0f` fixture replay reproduces the old
3.10 failure against the same production boundary. Distinct retained red/fixed-stage
logs bind each run to its actual test bytes.

The final test has 297 physical lines and retains all four original assertion
ASTs, adding exact owned-target and exception-cause checks. Targeted Ruff 0.15.14
and Pyright 1.1.409 report zero diagnostics. Only this test file changes Python
bytes from the prior exact 604-error baseline comparison; its baseline/current
diagnostic sets are empty. Whole-project typing remains a failed baseline gate.
Document checks resolve all 99 criteria and exact references; AST-only graph
refresh completes. Production, dependency/wheel, error-catalog and architecture
contracts are unchanged, so no new artifact payload or schema is introduced.
Corrected four-lane hosted execution and retained-report transport pass at the
verified checkpoint below. Local counts and skips alone do not establish them.

### Verified hosted runner checkpoint — 10cb15a

[CI 37257724886](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37257724886)
and [QML 37257724896](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37257724896)
are terminal successful normal PR attempt-one runs. Source
`10cb15a028312f21a169760e5f059a8f4ddfbfba`, base
`f61827f42378f6e7feff05a1cb4cbbcab1736ca8` and actual tested checkout
`697437305a9f8959ed6022fad3c676b4714caa0e` match API parent inspection, all source
identities and job logs. These results verify recorded profiles; they do not
promise unexecuted device events, unrestricted Qt SDK semantics or later revisions.

| Executed profile | Passed | Explicit skips | Failures/errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full Ubuntu Python 3.10.22 | 9,008 | 111 | 0 |
| Full Ubuntu Python 3.12.3/3.13.16/3.14.8, each | 9,007 | 112 | 0 |
| Native Windows Python 3.12 | 836 | 21 | 0 |
| Four Windows QML source lanes, each | 2,323 | 3 | 0 |
| Four macOS QML source lanes, each | 2,271 | 55 | 0 |
| Four Ubuntu QML artifact lanes, each | 3 | 0 | 0 |

All 40 assigned Linux cases (the prior 39 plus
`tests/test_publication.py::test_inc25_partial_setup_cleanup_fault_retains_safe_recovery_evidence`)
and the exact two live FalkorDB/three wheel cases are individually present and
passed in every source lane. Each complete job also passes end-to-end installation.
All four archive digests match the API. Every 182-payload wheel matches the tested
Git blobs; source/configuration, dependencies and wheel bytes are retained.
Dependency counts are 185/195/174/174 for Python 3.10/3.12/3.13/3.14. Both test
graphs are deleted and every pinned job-owned service is confirmed absent, with
zero mounts and verified image/readiness identity.

Native artifact `11323730916` SHA-256
`98e8645f9fd208b6502c62ea687fa83c81b48c6e190d9698ce62b85ffe1977b4`
matches its API digest and contains the actual 412-byte `shell-consumers.json`.
Both admitted Git Bash/sh executables identify the selected checkout Python and
Node 24.19.0, agreeing with the real preflight's same-file checks and job/profile
identity. All 18 helper, 33 former shell-failure, seven CLI and five tool-selection
cases pass individually; 197 dependencies, source inputs and checkout stay
unchanged. Retained JUnit, pytest exit, archive identity and upload completion
close INC-CORE-09's evidence gap; a workflow literal is not that proof.

All twelve optional-wheel jobs and all 24 isolated installed QML/core smokes pass.
Its platform suites remain source profiles with logs rather than per-case JUnit,
wheel-digest/source attestation or dependency-integrity artifacts. Skip contracts
are unchanged: Windows has two optional MCP cases and one optional SVG case;
macOS additionally has 28 Windows-readonly and 24 Windows-native-alias cases.
Windows/macOS Python 3.10 each retain two existing warnings. Parser/dependency
identities and grouped skips are retained in job logs; unavailable evidence is
not converted into individual-case or isolated-origin claims.

All five skill validators/134 generated artifacts pass. Advisory security
continues to report four High/eight Medium/109 Low Bandit findings and nine unique
pip-audit package/advisory identities across three packages; both scans exit one
under the existing advisory policy. Local full typing retains 604 matched baseline
errors with zero added/removed, while the changed test's diagnostic set is empty.
These contribution/system limits remain distinct from the passing test profiles.

Published test Git blob `66dec42c98e1d1f52d736e36cb369e3f5acf5000` has LF SHA-256
`285a9561f3262e3f75f77e893132bfcc3fb59d5a00ea6ed019b2a2e75a795886`;
the native tested file has SHA-256
`27f0b19efc055039b1b71339432fb8c2d396de4aa8de9a440c6610cdd313953d`.
Only two CRLF endings differ. All 682 tracked Python files match tested content
exactly or by CRLF-to-LF normalization, with no unmatched file. Production Git
payloads are unchanged from `f699b0f`. CI blob
`66a508759924cb222adee7010156a092c2f2b37a` and QML-workflow blob
`fc432d5a747483f1dcb10de88e768eda91ef1b44` bind the tested configuration.
This completion edits documentation only; later review revisions retain their
own normal PR validation and recorded SHA. No new reproduced defect appears in
the exit review; INC-QML-49 remains unallocated and no merge/deployment occurs.

### Manual discovery and native fixture contracts — INC-QML-46/47

The `38bf8cc` hosted Linux older-policy cases fail because the fixture omits
followed-directory discovery. The real manual parser separately rejects that
option with exit 2. INC-QML-46 adds the explicit parser option and retains its
default false, while every alias upgrade entry point uses the same supported
profile. INC-QML-47 corrects only the short-parent parser-spy expectation under
the already accepted INC-QML-45 long-spelling contract. Exact lexical symlink
ownership and every existing cold/warm/native/ID/retention assertion remain.

| Acceptance ID | Exact ordinary regression | Observable outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-QML-011-AC01/AC04 | `tests/test_qt_update_discovery_profile.py::test_req_qml011_ac01_ac04_cli_default_and_optin_reach_real_publication` | Actual parser and nested rebuild receive false/true respectively and publish identical facts/products when corpus scope is unchanged |
| REQ-QML-011-AC01 | `tests/test_qt_update_discovery_profile.py::test_req_qml011_ac01_optin_cannot_discover_foreign_qt_provider`; `tests/test_qt_update_discovery_profile.py::test_req_qml011_ac01_cli_help_exposes_supported_optin` | Real foreign alias cannot admit a native provider; actual help exposes the option and default |
| REQ-QML-011-AC03 | `tests/test_qt_update_discovery_profile.py::test_req_qml011_ac03_invalid_cli_profile_refuses_before_rebuild_or_publication` | Four actual unknown-option/multiple-root orderings reject before rebuild and retain accepted graph/state/cache bytes |
| REQ-QML-020-AC03; REQ-QML-011-AC03/AC04 | `tests/test_source_alias_provenance.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_policy19_products_refresh_retain_and_recover` | Real manual/watch opt-in refreshes the old-policy cohort; staged failure retains products/stamp, then repair/full parity/repeat succeeds |
| REQ-QML-020-AC03 | `tests/test_source_alias_provenance.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_directory_symlink_requires_explicit_discovery_profile` | Real POSIX directory link remains excluded by default and appears only with explicit discovery; native Windows cannot supply this profile |
| REQ-QML-020-AC01 | `tests/test_qt_project_membership_aliases.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_real_parent_alias_preserves_smoke_and_cold_warm_identity` | Exact native long-parent or lexical symlink parser inputs, warm unrelated cache, graph/IDs/membership parity and unchanged source bytes |

Source command: environment Python `-X utf8 -m pytest` with the focused seven
cohort/discovery modules, `-q --tb=short -p no:cacheprovider`, retained JUnit.
It passes **70 cases, two actual file-symlink/POSIX-profile skips**; all seven
new CLI cases and both upgrade operations pass. Broader CLI/watch compatibility
passes **253 cases, five existing capability/profile skips**. The separate
membership source module passes **nine cases, seven actual file-symlink skips**,
with one existing Hypothesis collection warning. These overlapping profiles are
not combined into a full-suite total.

Fresh wheel SHA-256:
`52a9c79c59ca2c1f985b3900655a6acf9f55b866b616e3d7f33d7767c17e449a`.
All 182 Python payloads equal source and installation; only CLI/help differs
from the preceding `c815eef8` wheel. Unchanged isolated QML/core and actual full-
TEMP short-alias smoke pass. Twelve ordinary installed modules run through
isolated `-I -X utf8` Python, `pytest --import-mode=importlib -p no:cacheprovider`,
with a retained JUnit report and an offline audit guard. Only exact owned native
junction fixture setup is admitted; analyzed code and network execution remain
forbidden. Result: **118 passed, nineteen explicit skips, zero failures/errors/
warnings**, 43.80 seconds pytest. Eighteen skips are actual file-symlink capability
exclusions; one is the POSIX default-discovery profile. All 69 assigned new/prior
co-owner/spelling/CLI/upgrade/native warm-input cases pass individually with no
skip. All 154 loaded Graphify modules come from that artifact. Source (682 Python
files), source 197/optional 40/core 30 dependency versions and original coverage
are retained; owned fixtures are removed.

Ruff 0.15.14 passes targeted/full source checks. Pyright 1.1.409/Python 3.12.14
reports **604 errors, zero warnings, 678 files**. The fresh immutable `135d50b`
baseline has 604 matching errors across 658 files: zero added or removed.
Ten touched targets retain two exact existing errors, with zero new/removed.
Typing remains a failed gate. Current CI consumer/configuration proof is recorded
above; repository AST-only refresh completes with 22,641 nodes/51,218 edges and
the existing deliberately malformed Luau fixture warning. No further local gap
is reproduced; the corrected normal PR event owns hosted acceptance.

### Discovered source identity — INC-QML-42

Hosted f95366d fails the unchanged original tests
`tests/test_cache.py::test_warm_cache_keeps_target_and_symlink_sources_distinct`
and `tests/test_watch.py::test_rebuild_code_incremental_rename_preserves_symlink_source_path`
in both completed Linux pytest profiles. The correction preserves their assertions;
actual Linux replay remains assigned to the corrected hosted run. Local actual
NTFS directory junctions reproduce six initial failures with one passing control
and one unavailable file-symlink case; stronger dual-alias assertions also expose
the shared prefix/stem lookup collapse and remain ordinary regressions.

| Acceptance ID | Exact ordinary test | Source/installed checkpoint evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-QML-020-AC01 | `tests/test_source_alias_provenance.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_discovered_directory_sources_survive_cold_warm_and_reload`; `tests/test_source_alias_provenance.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_leaf_alias_retains_its_source_below_an_aliased_root`; `tests/test_source_alias_provenance.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_native_definition_keeps_discovered_directory_provenance` | Real target/directory aliases and aliased scan root retain exact disjoint IDs/call endpoints, warm cache fragments, directed/undirected JSON reload and C++ definition provenance; leaf symlink remains a host capability exclusion |
| REQ-QML-020-AC02 | `tests/test_source_alias_provenance.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_foreign_alias_cannot_acquire_native_root_authority`; `tests/test_source_alias_provenance.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_failed_parent_anchor_keeps_only_accepted_physical_identity` | Foreign linked QObject remains excluded with exact QT_CPP_ROOT, unchanged source bytes and no native authority; failed lexical anchors retain only the accepted physical source |
| REQ-QML-020-AC03 | `tests/test_source_alias_provenance.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_watch_rename_deletion_and_repeat_preserve_discovered_source`; `tests/test_source_alias_provenance.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_policy19_products_refresh_retain_and_recover` | Actual two renames/deletion/no-change graph bytes, no-edit policy19-to20 refresh, staged publication failure/cohort retention, repair/full parity and repeat pass |

The full new selection passes **nine cases with one actual file-symlink skip**,
3.89 seconds. Existing cache/watch/ID/barrel/native/callback and alias/update
compatibility passes **405 cases with 31 capability skips**, 54.8 seconds.
The pure helper covers fifteen of fifteen measured statements and four of four
branches; isolated coverage storage preserves the original file. Facade/helper/
policy/test physical sizes are 8,998/31/114/277, within existing ceilings. Policy
20 refreshes older native/Qt products; AST schema 12 remains unchanged. Single-alias
shared-content notification is separately reproduced and assigned INC-QML-44.

### Nearby alias fixture — INC-QML-43

REQ-QML-020-AC01 additionally maps to
`tests/test_qt_nearby_alias_fixture.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_real_short_ancestors_preserve_nearby_facade_provenance`.
The original real five-ancestor fixture records one setup error with ten ancestor
hops; the corrected case passes with one real short-basename hop and unchanged
production source/edge equality. Existing/new alias modules pass **eight cases,
seven actual symlink capability skips**, one existing Hypothesis collection
warning. The source files measure 241 and 59 physical lines. No production
assertion, native SDK or graph/cache schema changes.

### Installed discovered-alias checkpoint — INC-QML-42/43

Wheel SHA-256:
`65a096a0042b181582f179fd63c1108479822bac866f7fab0d3eaf5fb7730309`.
All 181 source/installed Python payloads match; only facade, policy and new
source_identity differ from the preceding f2 wheel. The isolated unchanged
optional/core smoke and actual full-TEMP Windows short-alias smoke pass, with
129/123 loaded artifact modules. The five-module installed contract selection
passes **43 cases, eleven actual file-symlink capability skips, zero failures/
errors/warnings**, 13.58 seconds. All 153 loaded Graphify modules originate in
the artifact. The new source-identity module passes nine/one; the nearby-fixture
case passes. These overlapping counts are not added to full-suite totals.

Offline harness setup admits only ten exact seven-argument native cmd/mklink/J
fixture operations within its verified owned temporary tree. Sixty other process
attempts remain denied and no network call is admitted; owned junctions/temp data
are confirmed removed. This exception establishes real fixture setup, not corpus
execution authority. All 675 Python-file fingerprints, source197/optional40/core30
dependency versions, HEAD3c70bfc and original coverage bytes remain unchanged.
Separate source CI tool tests pass five cases without skips or warnings.

Full Pyright remains **604 errors, zero warnings, 671 files**, exit one, 20.651
seconds; every identity matches immutable135d50b under the same dependencies and
configuration, with zero added/removed. Targeted seven-file Pyright retains only
120 matched legacy-facade errors; the other six have zero diagnostics. Ruff passes.
This checkpoint excludes the subsequent INC-QML-44/45 correction and does not
establish corrected hosted or clean typing acceptance.

### Shared physical co-owner watch invalidation — INC-QML-44

Initial production probes reproduce stale facts after only one of two admitted
source owners is notified. Real junction and hardlink regressions retain full/
incremental equality assertions; the directory-rename case also exposes a shared
absolute-ID remap collision. The extractor owner corrects that collision alongside
INC-QML-45, without selecting source ownership through iteration order.

The new stateless helper measures 69 lines, facade watch 2,543 within its 2,550
ceiling, and focused tests 280/70. Isolated helper coverage measures 39 of 39
statements and ten of ten branches; original coverage is untouched. Combined
source/installed results appear below; corrected hosted acceptance is pending. Early
scan/stat bookkeeping remains outside the prior-product retention boundary;
cache-byte assertions establish the actual rejection point rather than a universal
promise about detection bookkeeping.

### Native entry spelling and shared ID ownership — INC-QML-45

Actual Windows short header/build-metadata spellings reproduce four membership/
source-identity failures with one passing foreign-root control. Admission now
precedes worker/cache work and verifies a native long spelling of the same file
without resolving discovered directory owners. The remap correction separates
primary walked claims from shared resolved forms; canonical supplied ownership,
unique-alias fallback and ambiguous physical forms retain distinct contracts.

An early ambiguous-control expectation excluded all builder stubs. The owning
contract instead rejects newly admitted source/native authority and arbitrary
alias selection; ordinary unresolved import stubs keep the upstream builder's
existing behavior. Raw producer facts and built stub roles are verified separately.
No graph-builder behavior or accepted-source policy is changed for that control.
The combined local results are recorded below; corrected hosted proof is pending.

### Combined source and installed checkpoint — INC-QML-44/45

Native Windows/Python 3.12.14 source selection:
**640 passed, 21 capability/profile skips, zero failures**, 114.30 seconds.
All 59 new cases above execute without skips. The retained exclusions are eight
cache file-symlink cases, two active-CWD removals, one Windows Git profile,
one watch directory-symlink setup, one watch file-symlink, four extractor
file-symlinks, one discovered leaf-symlink and three prior diagnostic-context
symlinks. Actual Linux/platform proof is separately assigned to hosted execution.
Focused new selections overlap this profile and are not added to its total.

Fresh wheel SHA-256:
`c815eef893aa928eb58287be2b56e41c22b99ba43999e2c3ec30026af82108ac`.
All 182 source/wheel/installed Python payloads match, with only the approved five
payload changes from the 65a096a checkpoint. Unchanged QML/core/full-TEMP short
smokes pass; 129/123 loaded smoke modules come from the artifact. The ten-module
installed profile passes **102 cases, eleven actual file-symlink skips, zero
failures/errors/warnings**, 34.49 seconds; all 154 loaded Graphify modules
originate in the artifact. All 59 new cases pass. Only 33 exact owned native
junction-fixture callbacks are admitted; 157 other process attempts remain
denied, with no additional process/network authority. Temporary junctions/data
are confirmed removed. Source fingerprints for 681 Python files, 197/40/30 source/
optional/core dependencies, basis HEADfca23e2 and original coverage stay unchanged.
Separate actual Windows CI tool tests pass five cases, no skips/warnings.

Source identity coverage: 76/76 statements and 22/22 branches; its broader control
selection passes 54 cases with eight capability skips. Watch co-owner coverage:
39/39 statements and 10/10 branches; all 21 ordinary cases pass. Both use isolated
coverage storage. Whole-project Pyright 1.1.409 retains **604 errors, zero
warnings, 677 files**, exactly matching immutable135d50b diagnostic identities
under the same configuration/dependencies: zero added/removed. Targeted ten-file
typing retains only 142 matched legacy facade/watch errors; other eight have zero.
Ruff 0.15.14 and 134 generated artifacts pass. Actionlint 1.7.12 reports no
workflow diagnostics; both complete native run blocks parse with zero errors in
Windows PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh 7.6.6. Workflow size remains 450 lines.
AST-only `graphify update . --no-cluster` completes with no LLM invocation;
graph counts are navigation output rather than correctness evidence. Current
hosted, typing and physical device/system gaps remain explicit.

## Individual acceptance assignments

The [follow-up audit](../docs/qt-qml/FOLLOWUP_AUDIT.md) supplies counterexamples for
REQ-QML-008-AC01/AC03, REQ-QML-016-AC01–AC04 and REQ-QML-017-AC02/AC03/AC04. The table's historical
passes do not cover those cases. Current INC-QML-17–20 correction evidence appears
below; affected criteria retain explicit expanded-profile gaps.
Exact opt-in probes and corrective increments appear in
[scope corrections](#follow-up-audit-scope-corrections).

Exact test references below identify executed cases. Documentation, privacy and
hosted integration reviews are explicit review evidence rather than invented unit
tests. Later revisions reverify affected evidence; preserve these identifiers.

The INC-QML-06/07 rows retain their original bounded-profile evidence. Expanded
shared-owner incremental contracts in REQ-QML-011-AC01/AC03/AC04 are assigned to
INC-QML-44; new input-identity failure and short-leaf contracts are assigned to
INC-QML-45. Historical passes do not verify those additions. Their current
source, installed and hosted results are recorded separately below when run.

## Native ownership correction and remaining gaps

The baseline follow-up audit A13 failed REQ-QML-008-AC01/AC03 and REQ-QML-016-AC01/AC04
for lexical aliases despite the earlier bounded passes in the individual table.
These statuses are partial/failed for the new cases. INC-QML-19 owns their
registration/emission/connection correction; INC-QML-11 remains inherited lookup.

INC-QML-10's bounded source-ownership correction is locally verified through the
production facade, graph assembly, JSON publication/reload, aggregate HTML and
real CLI upgrade/retention paths. The final focused ownership/context/upgrade
selection passes 88 cases in 7.38 seconds. The reviewed final-wheel Qt/QML, C++,
HTML and export selection passes 954 cases with seven documented skips. Exact
commands, artifact identity and red/green evidence belong to
[validation](../docs/qt-qml/VALIDATION.md#inc-qml-10-native-source-ownership).
These results do not establish browser appearance or new hosted/platform evidence.

Accepted unchanged-header contexts have separate production regressions in
`tests/test_qt_cpp_context_ownership.py::test_req_qml008_ac02_borrowed_complete_header_is_not_counted_as_two_definitions`
and `tests/test_qt_cpp_context_ownership.py::test_req_qml016_ac01_context_pipeline_preserves_owned_emission_through_json_reload`.
They map REQ-QML-008-AC02 and REQ-QML-016-AC01/AC04 to actual collector and
pipeline/join/build/publication/reload ownership, canonical IDs and unchanged
borrowed dictionaries. Genuine distinct-body and false/missing completeness
controls in the same module retain unproved endpoints; equivalent relative,
Windows-separator and absolute path spellings retain one body identity. These
cases first failed before the borrowed source/span transport correction and pass
within the final focused selection.

INC-QML-11 now corrects grandparent inherited-signal endpoint lookup under
REQ-QML-016-AC01/AC04 with the exact source/update evidence below. Earlier
immediate-base-only evidence is superseded for this bounded lookup profile. INC-QML-12/13 now have bounded source
implementation and regression evidence below. Missing/unaccepted class bodies,
collapsed overloads and dynamic targets retain explicit unavailable ownership.
A proven enclosing callable or accepted source file may contain the occurrence
without establishing its native class, QObject role or semantic target. These
corrections do not use containment as proof of a missing class or runtime call.

## Constructor and source-containment corrections

INC-QML-12 owns generic constructor declaration/definition proof and canonical
parent correction. INC-QML-13 owns native source-site/file containment, upgrade
invalidation and truthful community counts. Final reviewed policy-5/schema-7
wheel identity, complete suite and installed public source-file proof are in
[validation](../docs/qt-qml/VALIDATION.md#inc-qml-1213-current-source-and-view-evidence).
The earlier 1029-pass artifact used policy 4 and does not verify the final
source-file change. Each row retains its original criterion identity.

Current artifact/reload proof passes. |
| REQ-QML-011-AC03 | `tests/test_qt_source_links_upgrade.py::test_req_qml011_ac03_source_links_upgrade_reparses_unchanged_cpp` (extract/update; prior policy/schema 3/6 and 4/7) | Real CLI reparses unchanged accepted C++ at the same package version, retires incompatible AST entries, preserves unrelated Python and matches a clean rebuild; repeated operation is idempotent. Current policy 5/schema 7 source/upgrade and installed public-fixture evidence pass. |
| REQ-QML-011-AC04 | `tests/test_qt_source_links_upgrade.py::test_req_qml011_ac04_removed_admission_removes_source_overlay`; `tests/test_qt_source_file_containment.py::test_req_qml011_ac04_unowned_file_sites_refresh_and_remove_stale_links`; `tests/test_qt_constructor_ownership.py::test_req_qml016_ac04_and_qml017_ac04_constructor_updates_remove_stale_sites_and_preserve_failures` | Actual cold/warm, manual update and watch, edit/removal, no-change repeat and unrelated facts. Supported constructor/member cases require full normalized parity; exact generic overload identity remains unproved and is not passed by native source-file comparison. |
| REQ-QML-012-AC02 | `tests/test_qt_source_links_upgrade.py::test_req_qml012_ac02_failed_source_links_upgrade_retains_products` (force off/on); constructor mutation/retention case above (manual/watch) | Real malformed-source rejection retains graph, manifest, analysis stamp and applicable root marker; corrected retry and repeat succeed. These cases supplement earlier actual cache/publication-failure regressions, rather than proving every persistence failure by one fixture. Source and current installed public-fixture retention pass. |
| REQ-QML-016-AC01/AC04 | `tests/test_qt_constructor_ownership.py::test_req_qml016_ac01_and_qml017_ac02_constructor_owns_emission_and_write_after_json_reload` (namespace/plain; directed/undirected); `tests/test_qt_constructor_ownership.py::test_req_qml016_ac04_constructor_conflicts_cannot_invent_a_canonical_owner`; constructor mutation/retention case above | Canonical constructor/source ownership through assembly, JSON reload, query and affected; no fabricated delivery call. Duplicate bodies, foreign namespaces and collapsed overloaded delegation retain unavailable native target proof. Inherited endpoint gap INC-QML-11 remains unverified. |
| REQ-QML-017-AC02/AC04 | The same exact constructor emission/write, conflict and mutation/retention tests | Literal accepted resource handles independently authorize QML access in a proven source callable; native class authority is not guessed from that access. Current reviewed source/wheel/public-fixture proof passes; unsupported dynamic handles/provider adoption remain separate gaps. |
| REQ-QML-019-AC02 | `tests/test_html_community_links.py::test_req_qml019_ac02_internal_only_group_has_source_edges_despite_zero_neighbors`; `tests/test_html_community_links.py::test_req_qml019_ac02_external_source_edges_are_distinct_from_neighbor_count`; `tests/test_html_community_links.py::test_req_qml019_ac02_isolated_source_member_does_not_claim_internal_connectivity`; `tests/test_html_community_links.py::test_req_qml019_ac02_source_edge_counts_keep_direction_parallel_edges_and_self_loops`; `tests/test_html_community_links.py::test_req_qml019_ac02_invalid_preaggregated_source_counts_remain_unavailable`; supplied-meta/small-view controls in that module | Eleven emitted-script/exporter cases pass. Counts use canonical graph edges, preserve source inputs and do not add fake plotted loops; unavailable counts, escaping and ordinary small-view Degree remain explicit. No new browser visual run is claimed. |

The source-site suite first failed seven cases before correction. The actual
facade source-file case then failed until the pipeline supplied explicit fresh
AST IDs; absent origin on borrowed nodes remains insufficient. The current
focused containment selection passes 63 cases in 9.56 seconds. Final six-module
source proof passes 90 cases in 14.70 seconds; final source-file/upgrade proof
passes 20 cases in 6.06 seconds. The final reviewed artifact broad suite passes
1044 cases with seven skips and one existing warning in 137.43 seconds. All 154
Python payloads match reviewed source, wheel and installation. The installed
public fixture rejects damaged source with force/partial options while preserving
four prior products, then repairs and repeats successfully. The HTML link
suite first failed six cases, then passes eleven; its related exporter/CLI
selection passes 172 cases. Commands and revision boundaries are in validation.

## Planned adoption criteria

Owner: Qt/QML integration maintainer. The three work packages are implemented;
their individual local source and installed acceptance is recorded below. This
heading retains its earlier external anchor. AC07 is a separate header discovery
contract; it does not borrow verification from the native syntax criterion.
The [INC-QML-08 plan](../docs/qt-qml/PLAN.md#inc-qml-08--installed-project-adoption-hardening)
records scope and exit checks. Original REQ-QML-001–017 hosted evidence applies to
its original bounded profile only. Every row here is locally verified for Windows
x64/Python 3.12; current hosted lanes remain unexecuted.

| Criterion | Evidence or exact remaining gap | Completion increment | Status |

## HTML community-view criteria

REQ-QML-019-AC01–AC03 retain local verification at the Python exporter/CLI and
emitted JavaScript boundaries. INC-QML-16 changes AC04 by removing Overview; its
current control acceptance is locally verified at emitted-script and reviewed
installed-artifact boundaries. Native browser/device behavior remains unverified.
Node harnesses execute production scripts with the external
vis network isolated; they prove dataset admission, controls and source payload,
not a new browser-engine or visual acceptance run. Installed-artifact identity and
executed commands are recorded in VALIDATION.md.

## Project-membership projection

Owner: Qt project-metadata integration maintainer. INC-QML-14 owns all three
REQ-QML-020 criteria. Status: **Locally Verified for the bounded static public
profile**. The new production tests below have executed source, lifecycle,
consumer and reviewed installed-artifact evidence.
Current source/resource lookup, source-file containment and community edge counts
remain evidence for their existing boundary. Each independent membership site
must preserve declaration/target identity, direction, provenance and uncertainty
through the actual graph/consumer lifecycle. Qt policy 6/schema 7 at package
version 0.9.74 has source upgrade and reviewed installed public-fixture evidence.
Additional accepted-code-scope adoption checks pass; whole-root/provider/runtime
adoption gaps remain outside this closure.

| Criterion | Exact executed production evidence | Completion increment | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-QML-020-AC01 | `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_unused_component_has_persisted_build_and_resource_membership` (CMake/qmake; directed/undirected); `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_metadata_spans_survive_bom_crlf_unicode_and_sanitation`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_scoped_paths_repeated_declarations_and_query_keep_exact_identity`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership_updates.py::test_req_qml020_ac01_unused_packaged_component_survives_aggregate_export`. Targets uniquely accepted file/component endpoints, independent/repeated sites and same-name scoped files, `EXTRACTED` references, direction and original spans through facade/build/JSON reload/scoped query, unchanged loader/module lookup and actual aggregate-script membership counts. Source, consumer and final reviewed installed public-fixture evidence pass. | INC-QML-14 | Locally Verified (bounded static public profile) |
| REQ-QML-020-AC02 | `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_source_projection_rejects_unproved_membership`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_resources_reuse_existing_alias_guard_decisions`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_corrupt_literal_transport_is_rejected`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_location_prefix_cannot_authorize_another_source_span`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_projection_reads_no_targets_and_executes_no_corpus`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership_updates.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_failed_metadata_join_preserves_products_and_recovers` (manual/force/watch); `tests/test_qt_project_membership_updates.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_join_exception_cannot_publish_partial_memberships`. Missing, duplicate, conditional, generated, wrong-role and out-of-root cases must have explicit status/reason and no target edge. The actual helper executes before injected failure; graph/manifest/analysis/root-marker bytes must remain unchanged. Projection guards target reads/discovery/process execution and preserves borrowed facts. All assigned source rejection/retention and final installed public-fixture checks pass. | INC-QML-14 | Locally Verified (bounded static public profile) |
| REQ-QML-020-AC03 | `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_fresh_derived_sites_replace_borrowed_state_without_mutation`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_typed_file_role_survives_punctuation_and_borrowed_publication`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership_updates.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_metadata_resource_and_source_updates_remove_stale_memberships` (manual/watch); `tests/test_qt_project_membership_updates.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_policy_upgrade_refreshes_unchanged_packaging` (extract/update); `tests/test_qt_project_membership_updates.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_membership_ids_are_independent_of_checkout_location`; `tests/test_qt_project_membership_updates.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_pipeline_publishes_replacement_without_borrowed_mutation`; malformed-resource recovery and aggregate-export tests above. Targets cold/warm/full/manual/watch parity, source edit/rename with metadata/alias updates, alias duplicates, target deletion, stale-edge removal, stable unrelated Python/relocated root identity, accepted typed-file identity through punctuation/publication, fresh-site replacement without borrowed mutation and policy-5 to policy-6 refresh without source/package changes. Complete source/lifecycle/consumer and reviewed installed public-fixture evidence pass for the bounded profile. | INC-QML-14 | Locally Verified (bounded static public profile) |

The first actual lifecycle selection failed all four cases in 3.76 seconds before
projection existed: the public fixture had no `membership_resolution` sites.
The failure record is baseline regression proof. Exact executed commands,
artifact identity and remaining broader limitations are in
[validation](../docs/qt-qml/VALIDATION.md#inc-qml-14-membership-projection).
The frozen source-projection module passes 26 cases in 1.90 seconds; its positive
facade cases fail twice with only projection disabled and actual parsing/indexes
retained. The reviewed-wheel checkpoint's combined selection passes 37 cases in
8.77 seconds. Two added directed graph variants then pass within a final
39-case focused selection in 9.50 seconds, with no production change. The
reviewed-wheel broad selection passes 1081 cases with seven documented skips and
one existing warning in 135.53 seconds. All 155 Python modules are byte-equal
between reviewed source, wheel and isolated installation. The installed public
CMake/qmake/qrc fixture has six resolved membership sites, accepted consumer/HTML
results, and actual force/partial failure retention followed by repair/repeat.
Browser visual, other-platform and executable Qt proof are not claimed. The
additional accepted-code-scope adoption refresh also passes. That INC-QML-14
checkpoint contained 81 criteria; the subsequent camera requirement adds three
without changing earlier criterion identities or revision evidence.

## Temporary middle-button camera and Overview removal

Owner: HTML viewer maintainer. INC-QML-16 owns REQ-QML-021-AC01–AC03 and the changed
REQ-QML-019-AC04, depending on the existing REQ-QML-019 community-view contract.
Status: **Locally verified at emitted-script and reviewed installed-artifact
boundaries; native browser/device and other-platform behavior unverified**.
The tests below execute the actual
emitted navigation script with a recording camera/network boundary; a stubbed
network does not establish a browser-engine, layout or native-device result.
The initial-view module separately retains checked startup, controls, dataset and
source metadata assertions while removing obsolete Overview expectations.

| Criterion | Exact production evidence and boundaries | Increment | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-QML-021-AC01 | `tests/test_html_middle_pan.py::test_req_qml021_ac01_middle_drag_translates_both_axes_at_current_zoom` (24 horizontal/vertical/diagonal, four-scale, source/aggregate variants); incremental client delta divided by current zoom, preserved scale, no animation, and suppressed native middle autoscroll | INC-QML-16 | Locally verified emitted-script and reviewed installed-artifact boundary; native browser/device and other platforms unverified |
| REQ-QML-021-AC02 | `tests/test_html_middle_pan.py::test_req_qml021_ac02_release_cancel_blur_and_lost_buttons_end_drag`; `tests/test_html_middle_pan.py::test_req_qml021_ac02_capture_failure_has_window_fallback_and_no_lingering_drag`; `tests/test_html_middle_pan.py::test_req_qml021_ac02_invalid_camera_or_input_aborts_without_jump`; `tests/test_html_middle_pan.py::test_req_qml021_ac02_invalid_press_cannot_capture_or_resume_after_repair`; `tests/test_html_middle_pan.py::test_req_qml021_ac02_unrelated_pointer_and_nonmiddle_release_preserve_owned_drag`. Matching release/cancel, lost button/capture, blur/pagehide, outside movement/capture fallback, invalid finite/scale/derived-position and cursor restoration controls prove termination and no later jump | INC-QML-16 | Locally verified emitted-script and reviewed installed-artifact boundary; native browser/device and other platforms unverified |
| REQ-QML-021-AC03 | `tests/test_html_middle_pan.py::test_req_qml021_ac03_other_inputs_and_source_datasets_remain_unchanged`; `tests/test_html_middle_pan.py::test_req_qml021_ac03_filters_and_search_work_after_middle_drag`; left/right/touch/wheel coexistence and actual startup/filter/all/none/search/inspector controls preserve graph/payload/dataset metadata, node positions, physics and temporary camera-only state | INC-QML-16 | Locally verified emitted-script and reviewed installed-artifact boundary; native browser/device and other platforms unverified |

The focused command executes both current modules:

```powershell
.venv/qt-mcp-312/Scripts/python.exe -X utf8 -m pytest -q tests/test_html_middle_pan.py tests/test_html_initial_view.py --tb=short -rs
```

Result: **60 passed**, 6.57 seconds, with no skips, after restoring retained Qt
projection, metadata/span/attribute and endpoint-safe source-edge assertions.
The earlier 60-pass/6.71-second checkpoint precedes that assertion review; the
44-pass/4.99-second checkpoint precedes independent horizontal/vertical/diagonal expansion.
An earlier missing-hook selection has 28 failed cases; the integration owner's validation record owns its
exact command/revision. Earlier exporter/CLI/membership-consumer regression proof
passes 219 cases in 54.20 seconds before the sixteen additional geometry cases.
The final exporter/CLI/membership/inspector selection passes 231 cases in 53.15
seconds, without failures or skips.
Wheel-artifact/Qt HTML consumers pass seven cases in 4.60 seconds, and the legacy
export module passes 67 cases in 2.95 seconds. These recorded script/artifact
boundaries do not close native browser/device behavior. The final 231-case
selection and seven additional consumer/wheel cases cover 238 distinct cases.
Five touched owners pass Ruff; the four navigation/source/test owners pass
explicit-runtime Pyright with zero errors/warnings. Including the legacy
`tests/test_export.py` owner reports one unchanged `reportOptionalOperand` error
at line 1008, reproduced against the prior revision with the same explicit
include/exclude configuration. The narrow listener-registration adjustment does
not alter that optional-return expression, inspector assertions or type checks.

The reviewed production tree is `a991dd9fb2d638cf15fbb2c76499ed1f6ebd51ea`; wheel
SHA256 is `11e370a19d328a01b4e9e30726731c815b4ef58399833ff3d0a7c644f71e98f0`.
All 156 Python payloads match reviewed source, wheel and isolated installation.
The installed viewer artifact retains canonical/RAW data, checked startup and
source inspectors; actual emitted-script camera moves and release/blur/retry
cleanup pass. No private input identifiers, paths or source are retained here.
Helper/HTML/initial-view/middle-pan measurements are 116/789/245/223 physical lines;
the updated inspector harness remains within its documented 1377-line exception.
Qt policy 6 and AST schema 7 are unchanged; this is viewer input, with no source
execution, new SDK, persistence operation or graph diagnostic. Earlier Overview
and camera selection evidence is historical. A changed requirement is verified
only after its own applicable controls and failure/cleanup cases pass; broader
adoption, inherited endpoint and constructor-overload gaps remain independent.

## Follow-up audit scope corrections

Inspected production revision: `95adbdc165f44a96bf275a7870bb1da4d82a5bea`.
Public static fixtures; Python 3.12.14, tree-sitter 0.25.2 and language-pack 0.11.0;
Windows. No Qt SDK or corpus execution. The probes are explicit opt-in diagnostic
tests and retain correct failing assertions. Their default-discovery exclusion is
temporary audit ownership, not regression completion. The correction owner must
promote them into normal collection and reverify all affected criteria.

```

Final combined result: **15 failed, 7 passed in 3.38 seconds**, one existing Hypothesis collection
warning. Thirteen failing variants expose four wrong-target root causes; two more expose loader omissions.
The independent existing lifecycle selection passed **67 tests in 21.43 seconds**;
the final native/QML compatibility selection passed **60 tests in 4.85 seconds**.
Neither establishes cold/warm/manual/watch parity for a correction not implemented.
At that baseline audit, reviewed installed-wheel, complete repository suite and
new hosted proof were unexecuted for the corrections. Current per-increment
package proof and repository gate failures are recorded in validation; new hosted
proof remains unexecuted. See [audit](../docs/qt-qml/FOLLOWUP_AUDIT.md)
and [plan](../docs/qt-qml/PLAN.md) for scope, dependencies and delivery gates.

## Receiver correction evidence (INC-QML-17)

These current mappings supplement the historical audit/profile rows above.
The reviewed installed artifact passes 98 selected cases with no skips/failures;
exact wheel identity and dependency limits are in
[validation](../docs/qt-qml/VALIDATION.md#inc-qml-17-receiver-ownership-and-construction-trees).
Full contribution gates ran at INC-QML-20; documented baseline failures remain.

Existing QML scope/declaration/identity, loader, provider and reverse-update tests
also pass against that reviewed wheel. Factory providers, inherited native signal
ancestors and generic overload identity retain their separately recorded gaps.

## Declaration identity correction evidence (INC-QML-18)

These ordinary collected regressions replace A12's opt-in reproduction as current
acceptance evidence. Native/system lifetime and broader provider adoption remain
explicit gaps; the source profile does not execute a Qt engine.

Exact source/artifact commands and outcomes belong to the corresponding validation
section. Full contribution gates run at the INC-QML-20 integration boundary.

## Native alias and ancestry correction evidence (INC-QML-19)

Ordinary collected cases supersede A13's opt-in probe as current bounded source
evidence. Imported-header targets, inherited event endpoints and generic overload
identity remain explicitly excluded or assigned to INC-QML-11/15.

Exact executed source/artifact evidence is retained in validation; whole-requirement
verification remains bounded by recorded adoption/inheritance/overload/system gaps.

At the INC-QML-19 checkpoint same-file qualified canonical classes remained an
implementation gap under REQ-QML-008-AC02, REQ-QML-016-AC01/AC04 and
REQ-QML-017-AC02/AC04. The original negative control proved safe rejection.
INC-QML-21 adds independent producer identities and collected proof/update cases
below; the genuine same-file native-versus-widget assertion now proves exact
ownership without weakening the unrelated rejection controls.

## Literal loader correction evidence (INC-QML-20)

| REQ-QML-001-AC01/AC02; REQ-QML-003-AC01 | `tests/test_languages.py::test_qml_language_facade_preserves_source_declarations_and_spans` | CONTRIBUTING language convention, production facade and hand-checked declaration/original-byte spans; optional-parser absence is explicit skip, not acceptance |

The INC-QML-20 checkpoint retained failing opt-in INC-QML-22 cases under REQ-QML-017-AC02/AC04:
`tests/audit/probe_qt_reflection_type_shadowing.py::test_req_qml017_ac02_shadowed_reflection_type_cannot_create_qml_target`
and its positive control
`tests/audit/probe_qt_reflection_type_shadowing.py::test_req_qml017_ac04_unshadowed_sdk_reflection_preserves_targets_and_provenance`.
At the audited baseline twelve failures and two passes established the gap.
The opt-in probe remains excluded historical evidence; the ordinary INC-QML-22
regressions below now exercise the corrected rejection and positive controls.

The INC-QML-20 checkpoint retained the actual Windows failure assigned to INC-QML-23:
`tests/test_atomic_writes.py::test_write_text_atomic_refuses_a_readonly_destination_without_leaking_a_temp`
under REQ-QML-018-AC06. It failed on the original baseline and INC-QML-20
checkpoint. INC-QML-23/25 ordinary tests below cover the corrected actual OS
retention and caller completion boundary; wider adoption remains unverified.

## Follow-up correction evidence (INC-QML-21–27)

These cases extend the bounded profile; they do not close all wider adoption,
inherited-endpoint or overload criteria. Exact final commands, installed artifact
identity and contribution gate limitations are recorded in validation.

The [exposure chapter review](../docs/qt-qml/EXPOSURE_CHAPTER_REVIEW.md) names the
official mechanism checklist. Macro accountability is separately recorded in the
API inventory. Excluded audit probes remain historical evidence and cannot by
themselves verify release acceptance. Corrected scenarios use ordinary discovery.

Final source and installed acceptance for INC-QML-21–27 is recorded in
[validation](../docs/qt-qml/VALIDATION.md#final-local-follow-up-integration-evidence).
All executed correction cases pass. The installed publication symlink case,
existing atomic symlink/mode and external-symlink admission cases remain explicit
host gaps; optional language skips do not establish acceptance. Full repository
pytest and typing retain the separately recorded baseline failures. Broader
adoption/inherited native endpoint/overload criteria remain Partially verified.

| REQ-QML-018-AC07 | [Project/header adoption evidence](#project-and-header-adoption) | Local source/update pass; reviewed installed suite passes; wider hosted matrix unverified |

Current adoption criterion count is seven, bringing the catalog to 85 acceptance
criteria across 21 requirements. Earlier six-criterion counts describe the earlier
profile. No criterion is renumbered. Runtime execution, arbitrary include search,
Qt SDK equivalence and other platforms remain outside this bounded static proof.

## Exact constructor overloads

This fixture models the old identity seam; it is not a replay of every old release semantic. |

Former blanket overloaded-constructor rejection is superseded by this accepted
signature profile. Existing ownership rejection tests now use duplicate equivalent
signatures; they retain their exact-owner and corruption assertions. Delegation
keeps the actual body owner without inventing a direct delegation call. The
reference-return callable omission remains a separate INC-QML-29 gap under
REQ-QML-018-AC02/AC03 until its ordinary producer regression passes.

Source integrity additionally maps REQ-QML-008-AC02/AC03 to
`tests/test_cpp_overload_source_integrity.py::test_req_qml008_ac03_out_of_file_constructor_transport_cannot_bind`
and the exact containing-class/corrupt-file authority controls in that module.
The fourteen collected cases pass against the production binder. Source-size
authority does not turn incomplete SDK include evidence into type authority.

## Final adoption delivery

Profile: Windows x64, Python 3.12.14, tree-sitter 0.25.2,
tree-sitter-language-pack 0.11.0; Qt 6 source inputs with CMake and qmake. The
reviewed tree is `9f0ae4ea75f47539df8ec8a66f1493b9e7f52b2f`. All 179 Python payloads
match the built wheel and installed package; the isolated installed selection
passes 3,024 tests with 36 historical optional/platform skips. None of the newly
added regression cases skips. Exact commands, digest and full-gate exceptions are
in [validation](../docs/qt-qml/VALIDATION.md#final-adoption-delivery).

INC-QML-11 inherited endpoints and INC-QML-15 exact constructor identity retain
their existing individual assignments above and pass in the reviewed installed
selection. The final full source command records 8,630 passed, 59 failed,
178 skipped and three warnings; the exact 59 failure identities equal baseline
5c0f2ca. Full Pyright has no added diagnostic identities but remains failed.
Current hosted platform jobs, live service delivery and native browser/device
procedure have not executed for this source. A global Verified or release-ready
status cannot be inferred from the bounded local evidence.

## Current-upstream integration — INC-QML-49

Source checkpoint: 65103f8; incoming v8:35adf43/package 0.9.76. Corrected integration
proof passes at the recorded 8b6c9d2 checkpoint below. The plan's acceptance matrix identifies affected IDs before
implementation; concrete tests, commands, individual outcomes, baseline gaps and
reviewed source/base/checkout identity are recorded here as they complete.
Previous hosted results remain immutable checkpoints. Old skips or aggregate
counts cannot establish the new joint-boundary criteria.

The frozen native profile is Windows x64, Python 3.12.14, package 0.9.76,
tree-sitter 0.25.2/language-pack 0.11.0, AST schema 13 and Qt policy 22.
The ordinary joint selection executes 99 cases: **83 passed, sixteen explicit
POSIX traversal exclusions, zero failures**. A final context-only correction is
verified separately by all six native admission cases, with their exact code,
empty unavailable context, fragmentwise backend-body absence and repaired repeat
assertions. POSIX link/`..` controls require actual POSIX runner execution.

Three native cases pass through the real CLI, qualified file/symbol and exact-ID selection, same-name decoys, explicit duplicate rejection, directed/undirected controls and unchanged durable input. |
| REQ-QML-003-AC01/AC02/AC04; REQ-QML-011-AC01/AC04; REQ-QML-018-AC02 | `tests/test_upstream_qt_shared_integration.py::test_req_qml003_ac01_ac02_ac04_union_and_qt_native_cold_warm_reload`; `tests/test_upstream_qt_shared_integration.py::test_req_qml011_ac01_ac04_union_edit_removes_stale_member_keeps_native_endpoint`. Four native CMake/qmake cases pass with original spans, distinct same-named C++ union/native method ownership, real edits, stale removal and repeated output. |
| REQ-QML-020-AC01/AC02/AC03; REQ-QML-003-AC04; REQ-QML-011-AC03/AC04; REQ-QML-018-AC05/AC06 | `tests/test_qt_followed_metadata_alias.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_typed_producers_keep_distinct_alias_facts_and_original_spans`; `tests/test_qt_followed_metadata_alias.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_followed_metadata_facade_keeps_every_owner_cold_warm_and_reload`; `tests/test_qt_followed_metadata_alias.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_typed_alias_updates_remove_stale_facts_and_match_full_rebuild`; `tests/test_qt_followed_metadata_alias.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_alias_read_failure_retains_cohort_cache_and_repairs`; `tests/test_qt_followed_metadata_alias.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_membership_rejects_another_walked_owner_of_same_physical_input`; `tests/test_qt_followed_metadata_alias.py::test_req_qml020_ac03_policy21_alias_products_refresh_retain_and_recover`. All 43 native cases pass, including BOM/CRLF/Unicode spans, nested owner/target references, actual junction/root aliases, foreign inputs, malformed lexical context and native short leaf spelling. |
| REQ-QML-012-AC01/AC02/AC04; REQ-QML-020-AC02 | `tests/test_qt_source_identity_admission.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_native_admission_failure_keeps_its_code_and_recovers`. Six native production-reader cases pass after the final correction. `tests/test_qt_source_identity_admission.py::test_req_qml020_ac02_dotdot_input_keeps_actual_physical_target_and_containment` has sixteen Windows exclusions because actual POSIX physical link/`..` traversal is its test boundary; all sixteen cases pass individually in each recorded Linux lane below. |
| REQ-CORE-004-AC02 | `tests/test_extract.py::test_python_external_calls_survive_real_incremental_context` passes in the corrected native profile; all ten upstream extraction assertions remain structurally unchanged. The exact case is included in native hosted selection. |

The joint command is:

```text
python -X utf8 -m pytest tests/test_upstream_qt_cache_integration.py tests/test_upstream_qt_discovery_integration.py tests/test_upstream_qt_export_integration.py tests/test_upstream_qt_path_integration.py tests/test_upstream_qt_shared_integration.py tests/test_qt_followed_metadata_alias.py tests/test_qt_source_identity_admission.py -q --tb=short -rs --junitxml=joint.xml
```

Adjacent profiles pass 601 upstream/shared cases with eleven capability skips,
172 cache/stat-index/Python/Qt cases with eight file-symlink skips, and 271
export/path/direction cases with no skips. Counts overlap and are not summed.
Upstream multi-root stat-index warnings are retained. The original collector
leaks installed copies under both profiles; both immutable parent cache modules
reuse an old namespace; the old export loses a parallel relation and old path
lookup fails qualified identity. The prior full producer and current pre-fix
typed reader omit walked metadata; twenty ordinary alias cases fail before the
correction. Replays use actual immutable modules with current support imports,
not claims of full historical dependency equivalence or a checkout swap.

The corrected source wheel contains **185 Python payloads**, each byte-identical
to source and both isolated QML/core installs. Its SHA-256 is
`870a56e35e3a18afde2f7c13811e6e3fa8af53529f485a4399521133046d9d01`.
Both isolated installed smokes and all three reviewed-artifact tests pass.
Production and original coverage bytes remain unchanged during artifact proof.
The preliminary wheel precedes the final diagnostic correction and is not used
as final acceptance. Hosted wheels retain their own independently recorded digests.

Whole Ruff passes. All five skillgen validators pass, including 134 generated
artifacts. Frozen explicit-interpreter Pyright remains **605 errors, zero warnings**;
all new integration modules have zero diagnostics. Four errors move with an
upstream responsibility transfer and one Dart OptionalSubscript is reproduced
from the immutable incoming source. This is a failed existing contribution gate,
not successful typing. The final 197-distribution inventory changes only the
Graphify package version from the historical profile. No assertion, required
check, protection or historical commit is weakened or rewritten. Advisory
security and physical application/device procedures remain separate gaps.

Normal fork PR proof targets the exact incoming 35adf43 base on
`codex/qml-upstream-base`; the integration branch remains in the canonical
workspace. All prior PRs and the verified 65103f8 branch are preserved. No
upstream PR, merge, deployment or default-branch update is performed. Terminal
current head/base/checkout identities, cases, artifacts and cleanup remain the
hosted exit gate under REQ-CORE-004-AC01–AC04.

### First integrated hosted checkpoint — dbc4859

Draft [PR 7](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/pull/7) binds source
`dbc4859f454f9478ac9596559a75efef5f10664d`, base
`35adf432b9d50f6f3d530ab5d7ec316819ef081c` and actual synthetic checkout
`db0b4dd0829082dca1e222bc90a85571871fb4bd`.
[CI 37287514274](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37287514274)
fails the stale platform selector guard in Python 3.14; the other three full
Linux jobs are cancelled, so those profiles remain incomplete.
The completed Linux 3.14 profile reports 9,354 passed, one failed and 121 skipped;
all 34 joint cases, 40 applicable alias cases, sixteen real POSIX link/`..`
controls and five service/wheel cases pass individually. All four retained
Linux wheel payloads match the 185 reviewed source modules, and every disposable
service container is confirmed absent, including the cancelled lanes. The
cancelled suites have no completed JUnit/pytest-exit/integrity evidence.
[Wheel matrix 37287514235](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37287514235)
exposes the same guard in native source lanes and a distinct native metadata
fixture seam. INC-QML-51/52 own their corrections; this is a failed integration
checkpoint, not hosted release acceptance.
All four macOS source lanes report one failed, 2,360 passed and 64 skipped;
each Windows source lane reports two failed, 2,404 passed and nineteen skipped.
The four Ubuntu wheel lanes each pass three artifact tests. All 24 isolated
optional/core installed smokes pass. Those wheel jobs retain no per-case JUnit,
wheel-digest or source/dependency artifact; native platform tests import the
checkout and remain source evidence distinct from the installed smokes.

The [native Windows job](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37287514274/job/111689834160)
passes 923 cases with 37 explicit exclusions and pytest exit zero. All 34 joint
integration, 43 followed-metadata alias, six native failure/recovery and exact
INC-CORE-10 cases pass individually. The exclusions retain 21 previous cases
plus sixteen actual POSIX link/`..` controls. Artifact 11335540466's API digest
and downloaded ZIP SHA-256 both equal
`1ce081338cf8963694e37b52b66a949c3149c3ceae3a7ca43b2b158e2815868c`.
The retained preflight proves both admitted Bash/sh consumers, Python 3.12.10
and Node 24.19.0; checkout, tracked inputs and all 197 dependencies are unchanged.
The skill job passes all five validators and 134 artifact checks. Advisory
security has an API-success conclusion but both raw commands return exit one:
Bandit reports four high, eight medium and 112 low findings; pip-audit reports
fifteen raw vulnerability rows across three packages. These are failed advisory
commands, not a clean security scan.

### Platform selection guard correction — INC-QML-51

Affected assignments: REQ-QML-001-AC01/AC03, REQ-QML-014-AC01/AC03/AC04 and
REQ-CORE-004-AC03 map to
`tests/test_qml_platform_matrix.py::test_wheel_runner_keeps_optional_core_and_isolated_offline_smoke_boundaries`.
The original production runner correctly admits the new upstream/Qt modules;
its guard incorrectly requires the former two-prefix literal. Local original
platform execution reports one passed/one failed test. Corrected execution of
both platform tests passes on native Python 3.12.14, with zero Ruff/Pyright
diagnostics. The guard now compiles only the trusted runner's actual selection
expression and exercises real temporary files in native and artifact-only
modes, retaining every install/isolation/offline assertion. It rejects unrelated
language modules, runner helpers and wrong extensions; deterministic selected
names include the joint regression prefix.
The owned glob seam reverses actual fixture entries; stable ordering therefore
depends on the production sort rather than the host's directory enumeration.

Executed command:

```text
python -X utf8 -m pytest tests/test_qml_platform_matrix.py tests/test_qml_wheel_artifact.py -q --tb=short --junitxml=platform.xml
```

Without the reviewed-wheel variable this command passes two tests and explicitly
skips three artifact tests; that run is guard evidence only. The retained reviewed
wheel procedure and corrected hosted revision own artifact acceptance.
The same command with the final reviewed-wheel variable passes all five tests
without skips. The wheel remains byte-identical to the runtime checkpoint;
these corrections change test evidence only.

### Native metadata-growth fixture correction — INC-QML-52

REQ-QML-002-AC03, REQ-QML-012-AC01/AC04 and REQ-QML-014-AC02/AC03/AC04 map to
`tests/test_qt_metadata_boundaries.py::test_cmake_scope_limit_and_source_file_growth_are_rejected`.
The original fake stat carries only size and causes native identity admission
to reject before the intended read-growth boundary. Correcting the stat witness
must retain native mode/device/inode and every available non-size stat field;
the original cmake_scope_limit and metadata_size_limit assertions remain
authoritative. The original ordinary case fails on native Python 3.14.7 with
native_source_spelling_unavailable before the intended read boundary. After
the fixture correction all 35 module cases pass without skips on native
3.10.21, 3.12.14, 3.13.15 and 3.14.7. The fixture checks its understated size,
every real non-size stat field and actual same-file identity, retaining the
original two rejection assertions. It measures 99 physical lines. Source
runtime, dependencies and original coverage are unchanged; corrected hosted
source outcomes pass in the verified integrated checkpoint below.

Executed per-interpreter command:

```text
python -X utf8 -m pytest tests/test_qt_metadata_boundaries.py -q --tb=short --junitxml=metadata.xml
```

## Verified integrated hosted checkpoint — 8b6c9d2

Draft [PR 7](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/pull/7) source
`8b6c9d2bd4a89377829cb09c0737744aebccfb97` targets exact incoming upstream base
`35adf432b9d50f6f3d530ab5d7ec316819ef081c`. Both normal `pull_request` workflows
test actual synthetic checkout `0863b2b7e5c63a27b6d5185490b8b610cc997424`;
API parent identity and each job's retained checkout identity agree.
[CI 37289566337](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37289566337)
and [QML wheel 37289566340](https://github.com/SlinkyRamey/graphify/actions/runs/37289566340)
both conclude success on attempt one. All nineteen validation jobs pass.
The prior dbc4859 failures and cancelled profiles remain separate evidence.

| Profile | Passed | Explicit exclusions | Actual evidence boundary |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Full Ubuntu / Python 3.10.22 | 9,356 | 120 | Source suite, JUnit, pytest exit zero, retained identity/integrity and cleanup |
| Full Ubuntu / Python 3.12.3 | 9,355 | 121 | Same source/retention boundary |
| Full Ubuntu / Python 3.13.16 | 9,355 | 121 | Same source/retention boundary |
| Full Ubuntu / Python 3.14.8 | 9,355 | 121 | Same source/retention boundary |
| Focused native Windows / Python 3.12.10 | 923 | 37 | Actual Cmd/PowerShell/Bash/sh consumers, JUnit, uploaded report and input/dependency identity |
| Four Windows QML lanes / Python 3.10/3.12/3.13/3.14 | 2,406 each | 19 each | Checkout source profiles and separate neutral isolated installed smokes |
| Four macOS QML lanes / Python 3.10/3.12/3.13/3.14 | 2,361 each | 64 each | Checkout source profiles and separate neutral isolated installed smokes |
| Four Ubuntu wheel lanes / Python 3.10/3.12/3.13/3.14 | 3 each | 0 | Reviewed-artifact contracts and separate neutral isolated installed smokes |

Every Linux lane individually passes all 128 applicable integration assignments:
34 joint upstream/Qt, 40 alias, sixteen real POSIX link/`..`, two platform guards,
35 metadata-boundary and the exact INC-CORE-10 subprocess case. Nine new
Windows-only native/short-leaf controls retain platform skips. The five actual
FalkorDB/wheel cases also pass. The native Windows artifact individually passes
all 34 joint, 43 alias, six native-admission and the same subprocess case.
Its 37 exclusions are the prior 21 plus sixteen POSIX-only controls. Full skip
inventories retain their actual reasons; version-specific `tomli`, exhausted
bundle-fallback and absent optional graspologic comparison controls are not
relabelled as passes. The native partition test still executes independently.

All five source/native archives have downloaded SHA-256 equal to the GitHub API
digest. Linux artifacts are 11336600508 (3.10), 11336267743 (3.12), 11336132399
(3.13) and 11335669170 (3.14). The native artifact 11336246160 digest is
`c280b9aa51311e5bf02874cc90f0eea7bbeb54e759c44e09c8290d8a5a7d36ef`.
Its actual uploaded preflight proves both admitted Git Bash/sh consumers use
the intended checkout Python and Node 24.19.0. Linux dependency inventories
contain 185/195/174/174 distributions respectively; Windows contains 197.
Each before/after inventory, tested checkout and tracked input identity is
unchanged. All twelve Linux integrity flags pass. Real service readiness,
test-graph deletion and absence of every job-owned container are confirmed;
all four end-to-end install steps pass.

Each full-source Linux wheel's 185 Python payloads equal reviewed source bytes
and actual synthetic-checkout Git blobs. Their SHA-256 digests, in lane order
3.10/3.12/3.13/3.14, are:

- `1be83a0da3a89eb8824dd8a76b7445cba5a172f2cf52b76c5701dacf1ca375ca`
- `cd6e12dd0d8131651300d06a9c3d0baad46bc788f78fdb258eda872799864291`
- `3803242269198f47e6565dd6a9fe0ae0baecf5db323de430c4dc0afdb07661a6`
- `02f3bf909e13aa4f4aff0fb402c9ecc6a8fc5d58038f61b8f37ab4302100485f`

All 24 optional/core installed smokes pass from neutral directories with isolated
interpreters. Windows/macOS platform tests import the checkout; their workflow
retains aggregate logs, without per-case JUnit, wheel-digest or byte-attestation
archives. Those limits are not filled by a source total or another job's wheel.
Linux JUnit evidence establishes individual corrected guard and metadata cases;
Linux/native JUnit establishes their applicable integration and subprocess cases.
Skill generation passes five validators and 134
artifact checks. Frozen local source typing still fails with 605 errors; new
integration/changed fixture modules have zero scoped diagnostics.

Advisory security still has successful job metadata but failed raw commands:
four high/eight medium/112 low Bandit findings and fifteen dependency rows across
three packages. All twelve printed medium/high owner functions match immutable
upstream 35adf43 AST exactly; the 112 aggregate low findings are not individually
classified. A clean security or typing contribution gate is not established.
Physical browser/device/application interaction, Qt runtime effects, released
upstream delivery and merging remain outside this hosted source profile.

The final plan review finds no additional reproduced integration defect;
INC-QML-53 and REQ-QML-022 remain unallocated. AST-only refresh after the source
corrections completes with 23,247 nodes/53,843 edges and the known malformed Luau
fixture warning. No graph commit stamp is inferred from that update command.
This evidence completion changes documentation only. The later documentation
head receives its own normal PR validation; this immutable checkpoint does not
claim its unknown future head already passed. AI commit attribution and the
original coverage artifact remain preserved; no upstream PR or merge is performed.
