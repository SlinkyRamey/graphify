# Qt/QML implementation contracts

Status: INC-QML-00 through INC-QML-07 are implemented and verified for the bounded
static profile, with revision-specific hosted source/artifact proof.
Earlier INC-QML-09 HTML selection is locally verified at exporter/CLI and emitted-
script boundaries for its recorded revision. INC-QML-16 changes REQ-QML-019-AC04
and adds camera navigation under REQ-QML-021; those current contracts have local
emitted-script and reviewed installed-artifact proof. Native browser/device,
other-platform and new hosted behavior remains unverified.
[PLATFORM_MATRIX.md](PLATFORM_MATRIX.md) records declared installation lanes.
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) owns ADRs and
[traceability](../../tests/TRACEABILITY.md) owns individual acceptance evidence.
Dependency-directed cache optimization and Qt runtime equivalence remain deferred.
INC-QML-10 native ownership corrections, including accepted-context source/span
deduplication, pass local source, final broad and reviewed installed-artifact checks.
INC-QML-11 implements bounded ancestor lookup. Its installed integration and
INC-QML-28 emission admission pass the recorded local source/artifact profiles;
current hosted acceptance is tracked separately in validation and traceability.
INC-QML-12 constructor source proof and INC-QML-13 source containment/view counts
are implemented with local source and reviewed installed-artifact validation. Missing constructor class proof
cannot be supplied by a same-name header prototype; source containment alone
does not establish a native endpoint.
INC-QML-14 membership projection and INC-QML-15 bounded overload resolution pass
the recorded local source/artifact profiles. Current analysis uses policy 21
and AST schema 12. Expanded REQ-QML-020 alias contracts retain their separately
recorded hosted corrections; an earlier profile does not verify changed behavior.

## Ownership and dependency direction

Detection owns corpus inclusion. The QML extractor consumes an already accepted
source file and returns source-local facts. A Qt project index consumes accepted
metadata and C++ facts. The Qt/QML resolver joins those facts after extraction;
it does not rescan ignored directories or reinterpret corpus boundaries.
The graph builder and persistence pipeline remain authoritative for output.

New responsibilities should normally live under `graphify/extractors/` or focused
resolver modules, with thin registration calls in existing large modules. Avoid
moving unrelated language code as part of a feature PR.

Current mutable ownership is explicit: `FactBuilder` owns one source's facts;
module/scope indexes own lookup tables for one run and borrow declarations
read-only; the relationship pass updates fresh source-owned expression sites;
the writer owns durable publication. Unchanged context dictionaries are never
updated by a join. The index API has a read-only lookup contract, without ambient
project state or filesystem discovery.

## Source-local extraction contract

Use the established extractor result envelope (`nodes`, `edges`, and existing
diagnostic conventions). Additional resolution facts must be explicitly carried
through per-file results, cache serialization, path normalization, merging, and
incremental reconstruction before they influence persisted output.

Each fact needs a canonical root-relative source path, a source span, an owning
component/object scope, its literal syntax, and parser/version provenance where
that affects interpretation. Line-number conventions must match existing consumers;
validate column/byte offsets against UTF-8 and multiline fixtures.

Identity must distinguish a file component, each object instance, members, inline
components, and names declared in separate module/version scopes. An anonymous
object can use a documented syntactic scope path; document whether moving it
changes its identity. Never key instances globally by `id: root` or type label.

Do not treat a grouped property block as an object instance, a handler as a new
signal declaration, a string/comment as syntax, or a partial parse as an empty
successful extraction. Bindings retain a bounded expression span and references;
analysis never evaluates them.

Implemented fields live in `metadata.qml` with `contract_version=1`. Each import,
declaration, expression occurrence and metadata record is an independent node,
so the 50-item metadata list cap cannot discard required per-file records.
Names and literal paths are case-sensitive lookup values. IDs use the complete
root-relative filename and an exact-identity digest before normalizing with
Graphify's ID utility; component/object scope keys are fixed-width hashes.
Named declaration IDs survive line insertions, while expression-site IDs include
their source occurrence and can change when text moves.

`qml_facts.encode_metadata` adds bounded base64 `raw_values` companions for string
fields. `qml_facts.qml_metadata` returns decoded lookup values after HTML sanitation
or JSON reload; callers do not parse escaped display text. It rejects nonmapping,
over-50-field, nonstring, invalid base64/UTF-8 or over-512-encoded-byte transport.
The display metadata is not a second resolver owner. Malformed transport becomes
analysis failure/publication rejection; it cannot silently select a different name.

## Resolution contract

Build indexes from explicit module/type declarations, supported project metadata,
documented implicit directory visibility, and configured import roots. Track
alias, version, singleton, registration, and object/component scope separately.

Resolution returns one of resolved, ambiguous, external/unavailable, dynamic, or
unsupported. Only one valid visible candidate may produce a resolved endpoint.
Ambiguous and dynamic candidates keep evidence and a reason instead of an
arbitrary edge. A label match across the repository is insufficient.

The default analysis uses source and metadata already in the accepted corpus.
Optional SDK import paths or generated `.qmltypes` need an explicit configuration,
provenance, root/ignore policy, and version. Do not scan the machine's Qt installation
implicitly or infer exposure solely from C++ inheritance or `Q_OBJECT`.

Implemented entry points:

| Interface | Input/output and owner |
| --- | --- |
| `extract_qml(path, *, root=None)` | One accepted QML source to declarations/expression facts, edges and diagnostics; no cross-file lookup |
| `extract_qmldir(path, *, root=None)` | One accepted literal manifest to independently owned module/export/import/dependency records |
| `build_qml_index(nodes, edges, *, root, import_roots=None, native_index=None, project_index=None)` | Per-run `QmlProjectIndex`; accepted source paths and declaration/provider tables only |
| `resolve_type(file, component_key, name)` | Qualified/document-local type lookup; `Resolution(status, target_id, reason, evidence, candidates)` |
| `resolve_member(file, component_key, object_scope_key, name, *, lexical_names=())` | Component IDs, own/root/known inherited members and typed continuations; no global labels |
| `follow_member(target_id, parts)` | Continue a proven object or typed-property target; alias chasing belongs to `RelationshipLookup` |
| `module_script(...)`, `directory_script(...)` | Script namespaces use a separate role from object types |
| `resolve_qml_project(per_file, all_nodes, all_edges, *, root, import_roots=None, native_index=None, project_index=None)` | Append fresh source-owned import/type sites and resolved edges; do not modify borrowed context |
| `collect_qml_scripts(paths, per_file, *, root)` | Add QML-owned overlays only for admitted, referenced scripts and admitted literal dependencies |
| `resolve_qml_relationships(per_file, all_nodes, all_edges, *, root, import_roots=None, native_index=None, project_index=None)` | Update fresh read/call/alias/handler status, append compatible inferred target edges |

Import roots default to the explicit scan root. CLI/watch and generated assistant
AST guidance inspect the ordered project-relative `GRAPHIFY_QML_IMPORT_ROOTS`
JSON list and pass it explicitly through `extract` to the index. Direct API callers
pass `qml_import_roots`; they do not inherit that environment setting implicitly.
Ambient SDK paths and remote imports are excluded. Current layouts include unversioned providers and explicitly requested
`.major`/`.major.minor` directories. An observed available manifest version precedes
selection of the latest compatible type export. URI aliases stay document-local;
`qmldir import` adds visibility while `depends` does not. Internal/singleton checks,
missing versions and duplicate eligible targets retain explicit reasons. `prefer`
resource redirection remains unsupported by the `qmldir` resolver. The separate
Qt resource index resolves accepted literal QRC/CMake URL mappings.

`qmldir` is capped at 1 MiB/10,000 meaningful records. Lookup caps include 32 module,
inheritance or alias depth, 32 parts per member-continuation API call, 256-character
collected reference paths, 1,024 module-query steps and 50 candidate/evidence
entries. Truncated candidate lists are display summaries, never permission to
choose a winner.

Expression resolution respects parameters, block/catch/loop locals and hoisted
`var`; a per-use shadow flag remains authoritative if lexical display names are
capped. Reassigned local callables and computed targets remain dynamic. Pure
assignment destinations are not reads, but computing receiver/index addresses
and augmented assignment retains dependencies. Alias chains/cycles use bounded
lookup and never evaluate property getters. Current `this` denotes the source
owner; `parent` requires explicit static-parent evidence.

Name-based `Component`, `delegate` and `sourceComponent` barriers conservatively
separate body IDs. They do not prove a Qt runtime creation context or model roles,
and custom names can therefore be conservatively unresolved. Attached handlers
and runtime-selected `Connections.target` remain unresolved. For supported
`Connections`, mixed legacy/function styles mark function-style handlers ignored;
property change handlers get distinct inferred notify-signal facts.

Classic JS directive masking preserves byte positions. Supported `.mjs` exports
control importer visibility; unsupported re-exports do not expose matching local
functions accidentally. QML-owned script overlays have distinct identities from
generic JS declarations, and shared scripts gain no arbitrary QML importer's ID
namespace. Overlay parsing is bounded at 5 MB/100,000 AST nodes/depth 256 and 256
enriched files. No build tool, script, getter or Qt engine is executed.

## Graph projection and compatibility

Project accepted facts into existing node/file types and relation/context fields
where their semantics fit. Cross-file resolution remains inference unless the
existing evidence rules justify an extracted relation. Preserve the literal
reference's source span and the definition's provenance separately.

The baseline builder uses simple graphs. Before bindings and signals share
endpoints, establish a nonlossy representation for distinct facts and confirm
JSON/export/query round trips. A global migration to a multigraph is a separate
architecture decision; it must not be smuggled into a language-parser PR.

The implemented projection uses one source-owned node per occurrence. Declaration
containment is `EXTRACTED`; resolved site-to-target edges are `INFERRED`. Actual
contexts are `qml_import_resolution`, `qml_type_resolution`, `qml_binding_read`,
`qml_alias_target`, `qml_signal_subscription`, `qml_property_notify_signal`,
`qml_signal_emit`, `qml_js_call` and `qml_script_call`. Reads use `uses`, aliases
and subscriptions use `references`, and proven function calls use `calls`.
Signal emission uses a dependency to its declaration and does not invent a
synchronous call to handlers. Status/reason/evidence on unresolved sites remains
queryable without a guessed endpoint.

`qml_projection.allows_qml_script_edge` admits only the dedicated typed QML script
exception through the existing cross-language guard: import proof names the exact
accepted script file/path/role, and calls target QML script-function overlays.
Generic JS callers and unrelated C++ edges keep their existing rules. On reload
of an undirected graph, `load_node_link_graph` restores QML edge `_src`/`_tgt`
from serialized endpoints; consumer direction uses these values, not iteration
order. Build/JSON preservation does not establish all INC-QML-07 presentation support.

Any new fields need compatible defaults, serialization tests, and a cache/version
decision. Remapping IDs must also remap resolver-fact keys, references, and provider
indexes, not just node IDs and edge endpoints.

## Qt events and bidirectional object boundaries

REQ-QML-008 supplies the registered C++ surface to QML. REQ-QML-016 adds native C++
signal/slot semantics independently of the QML parser. REQ-QML-017 follows C++
consumers of QML objects and literal context/initial-property providers back to
their scoped declarations. These are implemented bounded source contracts,
with acceptance evidence and remaining consumer/release gates in traceability.

Retain source-owned emission, connection, disconnect, load, lookup and member
access sites. Existing `contains`, `uses` and `references` relations project
their endpoints; `metadata.qt` retains endpoint roles, signatures, conditions,
declared connection flags, source spans and `bridge_direction`. The implemented
collectors/resolvers retain their exact per-role contexts; `qt_signal_emit`,
`qt_connect_signal` and `qt_cpp_qml_invoke` are examples. Source-owned sites and
endpoint-role nodes distinguish connect, disconnect, load, lookup, property
read/write and provider exposure through the existing simple graph.

An emission refers to a declared signal. A connection refers to its sender signal
and receiver callable/signal, with a separate context object for functors when
supplied. Direct slot calls and calls inside a connected lambda remain ordinary
calls. Do not turn event propagation into caller-to-slot `calls` edges. Support
member pointers, compatible ordinary C++ receiver members, overload selectors,
signal-to-signal, lambdas/functors and legacy `SIGNAL`/`SLOT` signatures only with
source/type evidence. Private slots can be meta-object connection endpoints even
though direct invocation follows C++ access rules. That does not automatically
make private slots a QML API. Preserve declared Auto/Direct/Queued and other
flags without claiming runtime thread affinity, registration success or delivery
order; retain the documented UniqueConnection limitation for functor targets.
See [Qt signals and slots](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/signalsandslots.html) and
[QObject connections](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qobject.html#connect).

Reverse lookup requires a bounded provenance chain: supported literal loader,
same engine/component/view, uniquely identified root or created object, optional
literal objectName lookup, then a declared member/signature. Initial profiles
cover engine `load`/`loadFromModule` with `rootObjects`, component loading/creation,
and QQuickView `setSource` with `rootObject`. Relative URLs need a known URL base;
they are not automatically relative to C++ source. A QML `id` is not a findChild
objectName. Duplicate names/roots, pointer escape/reassignment and computed names
remain unresolved or conditional. Property read/write and meta-object invocation
retain API variant and access direction; invocation is dispatch evidence rather
than proof of synchronous execution. A declared QML signal connects to C++ using
the same connection-site contract. See
[C++ interaction with QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qtqml-cppintegration-interactqmlfromcpp.html)
and [QQuickView](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qquickview.html).

Literal setContextProperty, typed setContextObject and named initial-property maps
retain the provider and receiving context/component. Respect known explicit
property precedence and context boundaries. They cannot add a repository-global
name. Arbitrary provider dataflow and runtime replacement stay deferred. Both
directions and native event facts must survive simple graph projection and
consumer output; changed QML APIs must invalidate unchanged C++ consumers.

## Incremental lifecycle and failures

QML and Qt metadata extraction bypass AST cache reads and writes. A Qt analysis
context also bypasses native syntax cache; plain C++ retains portable syntax
caching. Generic JS retains its existing cache-bypass rules, and QML overlays are
constructed for the current run. INC-QML-06 refreshes the accepted code corpus after
provider/script/source changes and parser/import/admission-configuration changes.
Dependency-directed reuse is a later optimization, not a completion prerequisite.

`require_complete_qml` rejects failed, partial or omitted source contributions and
script/join failure markers before graph reconciliation and publication, including
force/partial-output requests. Prior graph/manifest/report output bytes remain
intact. Unsupported subfolder scoped-ID rebasing is rejected separately. Earlier
scan/stat bookkeeping is outside the durable-output guard. See [ERRORS.md](ERRORS.md)
for diagnostic ownership and recovery, rather than treating unresolved coverage
as parser/write failure.

File-content hashes alone cannot validate links dependent on module manifests,
C++ registrations, resource aliases, import configuration, or parser upgrades.
The analysis checkpoint covers installed parser/package versions, Qt fact/policy
versions, ordered roots, accepted paths, ignore files and caller exclusions.
Changed providers/configuration trigger fresh resolution even without a QML edit.

The implemented fallback rebuilds already accepted inputs and removes stale
derived facts after deletion, rename, duplicate-provider or ignore changes.
It never rereads deleted/ignored inputs or expands configured lookup roots.
An unavailable parser cannot create a successful empty cache entry. The checkpoint
is committed only after graph/manifest publication; failed analysis preserves
prior graph/manifest/checkpoint bytes. Unsupported scoped subfolder rebases reject
before publication. Dependency-directed optimization must preserve these contracts.

## Verification boundaries

Test production extractor, resolver, build, serialization, update, and consumer
interfaces. Fixture output must be hand-checked against source facts, not generated
from the implementation under test. Compare normalized output across cold/warm,
full/incremental, relative/absolute, and Windows/POSIX cases.

Each feature increment updates [requirements](../REQUIREMENTS.md),
[traceability](../../tests/TRACEABILITY.md), support documentation, and any changed
design decisions in the same PR. Dynamic object creation, arbitrary plugin code,
full preprocessing, and arbitrary build-script evaluation remain explicit limits.

## Implemented native Qt contracts (INC-QML-04)

`qt_qml_pipeline.resolve_qt_qml` owns scratch integration after final generic C++
canonicalization. Exposure, events and object access have focused collectors and
per-run indexes. Every native fact uses recursive, bounded raw semantic transport;
malformed or oversized transport fails rather than becoming a guessed endpoint.
All target IDs refer to accepted canonical declarations or independent owned facts.

Native emissions use `uses`/`qt_signal_emit`. Connection/disconnection endpoint
roles use `references` and their own source sites. Reflective QML method intent
uses `calls`/`qt_cpp_qml_invoke` only for an evidenced declared function; the distinct
context and `operation=invokeMethod` retain its reflective mechanism. This category
records source intent and does not assert successful runtime invocation or delivery.
Qt connection flags and conditional registration are source configuration evidence.

Literal loader URLs establish source components; source-local handles model
roots and objectName lookup. QML id is never an objectName. The follow-up audit
found that reflective member lookup can fall back to the QML root, child lookup
can cross the receiver subtree, and distinct same-named engines can share a
provider at the audit baseline. INC-QML-17/18 correct those bounded ownership
and declaration forms; the ordinary regressions and installed artifacts prove
them independently. Static reflection API shadows remain INC-QML-22.
Duplicate exposures retain uncertainty. All joins borrow prior corpus dictionaries
read-only. `qml_failures` and `qt_failures` both enter the publication integrity gate.
No force/partial option can publish an incomplete Qt overlay.
That integrity gate rejects recorded analysis failures; it does not detect a
semantically incorrect target labeled resolved. The independent persisted-edge
probes in [FOLLOWUP_AUDIT.md](FOLLOWUP_AUDIT.md) cover that distinction.


INC-QML-05 activates the internally packaged metadata readers at discovery/dispatch.
After native overlays borrow final C++ IDs, QtProjectIndex supplies real source
membership to QtQmlBridgeIndex and both QML resolvers. Resource aliases resolve
only accepted targets. Generated/source disagreements attach to the fresh source
result as warnings; partial metadata participates in the publication failure gate.
Versioned Qt/QML namespace-shaped facts bypass generic C# namespace merging,
retaining distinct provider and repeated resource identities.


INC-QML-06 owners: qt_incremental computes accepted-input refresh/cache policy without
scanning directories; qt_analysis_state inspects accepted ancestors and produces a
frozen checkpoint. CLI/watch own successful publication and checkpoint commit.
Each parallel worker receives native-cache bypass explicitly; no mutable global
root or policy is introduced. Borrowed context facts remain read-only. Native Qt
scoped facts reject subfolder path-only rebasing; callers update the project root.

<a name="qml-07-consumer-and-assistant-contracts"></a>

## INC-QML-07 consumer and assistant contracts

Search projects bounded decoded semantic fields under `graphify_qt_qml` rather
than assuming nested metadata is searchable. Query/explain/path and installed MCP
consume the same source-scoped persisted facts; logical endpoint direction survives
default undirected JSON reload. Affected traversal promotes source-owned sites
through current source-owned containment, respecting the selected dependency
relation. Normally owner, site and containment fact share a source file. A
canonical C++ header declaration may own an implementation site only when its
accepted `definition_file` matches that site's file, the declaration is callable,
and extracted Qt containment proves the exact owner ID, child endpoint and
original span. A foreign file or unproven definition cannot establish ownership.
Emission/connection evidence remains distinct from ordinary direct calls.

HTML exposes source/event/access evidence and uncertainty; coverage counts
unresolved sites separately from resolved-edge confidence. JSON is the canonical
semantic backup. Other formats have individual retention/omission contracts in
[EXPORT_MATRIX.md](EXPORT_MATRIX.md), including undirected GraphML direction loss
and presentation-only Canvas/Obsidian/SVG limits. Driver payload tests do not prove
live database insertion/readback or stale-record cleanup.

Generated assistant extraction reads the trusted root and inspects configuration
without writing state. It passes `qml_import_roots` and `refresh_native` explicitly,
then calls the production integrity gate before AST JSON publication. CLI/watch
alone own the final analysis checkpoint. Authoritative fragments and frozen
generator guards are validated together; artifacts are regenerated rather than
edited independently. Hosted proof must be rerun for the final INC-QML-07 head.

## Valid native syntax recovery during adoption

`extractors/qt_cpp_syntax.py` retains original source/lexical views and delegates
only the recovery parse view to `extractors/qt_cpp_compat.py`. The caller supplies
its bounded parser and iterative traversal; the helper owns no roots, files,
mutable state, cache or persistence. An AST-confirmed empty parameter default is
omitted only in the equal-length parse view. A standalone Qt `Q_UNUSED` statement
uses the macro's existing bytes for its void cast and supplied semicolon while
preserving evaluated argument/call bytes. Original facts, declaration types and
locations still use the original source. Comments, strings, directives, local
macro overrides, ordinary declared/qualified functions, value contexts and
malformed controls cannot authorize recovery. This corrects supported syntax;
it does not relax the graph integrity guard or infer runtime targets.

The lexical owner recognizes C++ preprocessing-number tokens before quote
masking. Numeric digit separators therefore cannot obscure later Qt annotations
or signal sections. Numeric bytes remain unchanged and the parser validates their
syntax; malformed separators do not acquire a successful recovery. Character,
string, raw-string and comment exclusion retain their existing ownership.

The same-version development upgrade uses a new AST cache schema and Qt policy
epoch to prevent reuse of pre-correction declarations/graphs. Conservative native
refresh relevance includes the accepted syntax candidates; unrelated plain C++
keeps its portable cache behavior. Epoch/schema migration invalidates obsolete
AST artifacts under upstream cache ownership; compatible current cache data,
semantic cache and prior accepted graph/manifest/state remain protected on a
failed candidate. The graph writer still commits analysis state after successful
publication. See the exact regression/evidence inventory in IMPLEMENTATION.md.

## HTML community-view ownership

`exporters/html_communities.py` validates complete, disjoint membership for a
large aggregate view. Missing or invalid presentation grouping is recovered on
an export-local graph copy through the existing clustering interface. It fills
missing labels through the existing hub labeler and discards labels tied to a
replaced partition. Small full-node views preserve their existing membership.
Neither grouping recovery nor HTML export changes canonical source facts,
analysis sidecars or graph JSON. The atomic writer retains the previous HTML
until successful replacement; CLI status reflects actual publication.

The HTML viewer starts with Select All checked and all exported view nodes and
edges active in its datasets before layout. Large graphs keep their complete
labeled community aggregate and supported cap; startup selection does not
replace that view with raw full-source rendering. INC-QML-16 removes the Overview
button, its reset function/state and ten-community ranking. Community filters,
search, Select All and Select None keep their existing selection roles. Full exported semantic
payloads remain in the artifact. Community names describe structural hubs;
canonical architecture and design documents retain intentional component
ownership. View selections, camera and search are temporary browser state, with
no saved-view persistence. Earlier checked-default/Overview AC04 proof belongs to
its prior revision; current removal/coexistence checks pass at emitted-script and
reviewed installed-artifact boundaries. [Earlier selection proof](VALIDATION.md#inc-qml-09-current-selection-policy)
and [current removal/navigation proof](VALIDATION.md#inc-qml-16-middle-mouse-navigation-and-overview-removal)
retain their revision boundaries. Native browser/device and other-platform/hosted
checks remain separate unexecuted evidence.

## Native ownership authority (INC-QML-10)

The correction adds `is_definition` to version-1 Qt class facts, derived solely
from the parsed class/struct body's presence. Forward declarations remain owned
facts with their existing canonical IDs and spans; they do not supply complete
class authority to out-of-line binding or native event type lookup. The mapper
and event index require a unique accepted complete definition, preserve ambiguity
between distinct complete definitions, and leave forward-only or unsupported
evidence unresolved. The flag does not establish QML exposure or a runtime object.

`qt_cpp_mapping.CppMapping` maps out-of-line methods using their exact accepted
canonical `definition_file` and `definition_location`, original source span,
callable identity and class-containment evidence. Header provenance remains the
declaration owner; the implementation owns its emitted/access source sites.
These two locations are complementary evidence, not permission to bind a method
in any matching file or namespace. Do not delete forward declarations, merge IDs
by label, relax signature/owner checks or fabricate calls to remove isolated nodes.

`qt_cpp_exposure` transports definition authority and carries it through global
binding; `qt_event_index` consumes it when establishing class-qualified endpoints.
Borrowed complete-class records also transport the producer's exact `source_file`
and original `span`. A fresh AST record and an accepted unchanged-context fact
for one canonical body share that identity and count as one definition. Copying
only ID/name/definition authority loses the body key and creates false ambiguity.
Inputs stay read-only; deduplication cannot merge distinct body locations or
compensate for missing provenance by a name guess.
Indexes remain per-run and borrowed canonical nodes remain unchanged. At the
INC-QML-10 snapshot, Qt policy epoch 3 forced same-package analysis refresh for
old ownership facts and AST cache schema remained 6. INC-QML-12/13 subsequently
use policy 5/schema 7 with the same graph/manifest/checkpoint publication ordering.
Direct/pipeline/build/reload context and ownership tests pass locally. This
internal body-identity transport correction changes no persisted fact contract;
policy epoch 3 and AST schema 6 were appropriate for that revision. Final broad and reviewed
installed-artifact proof passes locally; see
[INC-QML-10 validation](VALIDATION.md#inc-qml-10-native-source-ownership).

## Inherited-signal lookup (INC-QML-11)

`QtEventIndex` owns a run-local, cycle-safe lookup over at most 32 uniquely
accepted complete classes. Canonical base names and their source-owned access
come from the native class producer. Each branch stops at its first same-name
declaration before role, signature and visibility filters. An ordinary member
therefore shadows an ancestor signal. Repeated paths to one canonical declaring
member deduplicate; different declaring classes remain ambiguous even when a
selector matches only one branch. Missing, duplicate, partial, conditional,
corrupt or over-limit ancestry cannot lend endpoint identity.

External typed member pointers require public inheritance as well as the existing
member-access checks. Each comma resets class/struct default base access; comments
and `virtual` spelling do not authorize visibility. Legacy meta-object lookup and
owning emission retain their separate access rules. The index adds no runtime
conversion, object-instance, scheduling or thread-safety claim.

Policy 13 refreshes derived Qt facts at unchanged source/package versions. AST
schema remains 9 for this increment; the later constructor/header migration owns
schema 10. Source, JSON/query/affected and actual manual/watch mutation, retention
and repaired retry checks pass locally. Installed integration remains pending.
An unchanged explicit emission whose declaration disappears exposed a collector
admission gap; INC-QML-28 owns that correction, independently of endpoint lookup.

## Constructor source proof (INC-QML-12)

The generic C++ producer augments constructor prototypes that tree-sitter emits
as class-body `declaration` nodes. `cpp_constructors.py` owns bounded exact
qualified names, original-byte spans, normalized parameter-type signature hashes
and ambiguity. `metadata.cpp_class` version 1 records complete-body authority;
`metadata.cpp_constructor` version 1 records declaration/definition identity and
class-binding outcome. Literal names use bounded base64 transport so display
sanitation cannot alter identity. No native Qt role or runtime object is implied.

The engine hook runs only for accepted C++ inputs; the existing declaration/
definition canonicalization calls the focused binder before its normal merge.
A unique complete class, matching unambiguous constructor prototype, exact scope,
signature and accepted source-backed method containment authorize a class join.
Supported singleton definition IDs are retained; missing header prototypes use
the existing ID formula. Unsupported overload collisions can use the baseline
ID disambiguation path and do not establish distinct overload identity.
Qualified namespace definitions need not merge into a differently
keyed header symbol. Both accepted identities retain their own provenance.

Collapsed overloads, missing/malformed facts, foreign scope, mismatched signatures
or conflicting owners cannot authorize a class join. Signature normalization
retains word boundaries, excludes parameter names/defaults and does not resolve
aliases or compiler conversions. Unsupported delegation/overload cases remain
unknown rather than gaining a guessed class. `constructor_class_authorized`
allows consumers to reject class authority without losing an independently
accepted source callable.

Native mapping consumes the exact body candidate and this guard. An unbound or
legacy out-of-line constructor cannot be replaced with a same-name header
prototype. Its source callable may contain observed sites, but `this` cannot
acquire a native type from that spelling alone. Independently typed local
handles and literal QML access retain their own evidence.

## Source containment and aggregate counters (INC-QML-13)

`qt_cpp_exposure._class_facts` keeps accepted class containment first. Without
Qt class authority, a member occurrence may instead be contained by its uniquely
resolved canonical callable; a local class occurrence may be contained by its
accepted enclosing callable. The fallback requires an actual callable node,
never a class-like target or global label. Class IDs, native roles and unresolved
class status remain unchanged. Unknown/conflicting callable evidence adds no
link. Borrowed nodes and edges remain immutable.

`qt_source_containment.attach_qt_file_sites` adds file-to-occurrence `contains`
edges with context `qt_source_file` when callable ownership remains unknown.
It reuses a unique accepted code file node with exact in-root path, filename
label, L1 location and no callable/class/semantic role. Fresh AST identities
are supplied explicitly before final facade tagging; borrowed context requires
its persisted AST marker. Duplicate, foreign or unmarked borrowed candidates
fail closed. Original spans and endpoint direction survive publication. File
context does not populate `owner_id`, class identity or semantic resolution.

The HTML aggregate counts each canonical source-graph edge once as internal to
a community or external at both incident communities. Distinct neighboring
communities remain a separate count. Canonical self-loops and parallel/directed
edges are counted as represented by the input graph; serialized duplicate
occurrences are not additional edges. Counts add no aggregate self-loops or
synthetic relationships. The inspector distinguishes closed connected groups
from actual isolates. A pre-aggregated caller without source counters displays
unavailable counts; ordinary source-node Degree and Select All remain unchanged.

The reviewed INC-QML-12/13 artifact uses AST cache schema 7 to retire older C++
producer facts at the same package version. Its Qt policy epoch 5 invalidates
derived constructor/source-ownership facts, including
the intermediate policy-4 analysis produced before source-file containment.
Graph/manifest/checkpoint persistence owners and publication order are unchanged.
INC-QML-14 subsequently uses Qt policy 6 with schema 7; this earlier artifact's
proof remains tied to its constructor/source-containment revision.
Migration discards incompatible AST cache entries; failed analysis retains prior
graph/manifest/root/Qt state and requires a corrected retry. This is different
from promising incompatible old-cache retention.

### Legacy file cohesion exceptions

Inherited dependency exception: `graphify/extractors/markdown.py::_active_scan_root`
imports the extraction facade and reads `_XAML_ACTIVE_EXTRACT_ROOT`, unchanged
from imported `0b60d47`. Owner: Markdown extractor maintainer; permitted scope is
that existing helper only, with no new consumers or ambient state. Exit: a separate
characterized refactor passes scan root explicitly while preserving vault-link
fallback, cache lifetime, direct-extractor behavior and parallel-worker semantics.
Review this exception before changes to either owner; it does not apply to Qt/QML
extractors or authorize facade imports elsewhere.

| Owner/file | Current measured size / permitted ceiling | Rationale and extraction exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML exporter maintainer: `exporters/html.py` | 789 / 810 physical lines | Existing embedded template and recursive aggregate projection share serialization. INC-QML-16 removes Overview and injects the isolated camera helper through a narrow seam, retaining this ceiling. Extract aggregate projection or template responsibility in a separate characterized viewer increment when the next cohesive change requires it. |
| Generic extractor maintainer: `extractors/engine.py` | 7694 / 7700 | Five-line constructor producer hook only; domain logic belongs to `cpp_constructors.py`. Continue the upstream mechanical migration sequencing rather than mixing unrelated language moves into this fix. |
| Generic resolver maintainer: `extractors/resolution.py` | 3974 / 3980 | Six-line pre-merge/guard hook only; the helper owns constructor decisions. Extract the existing declaration/definition responsibility as a separate characterized increment when upstream sequencing permits. |
| Extractor facade maintainer: `extract.py` | 9009 / 9010 physical lines | One existing canonicalization call supplies raw calls to the same resolver owner; preserve dispatcher direction and extract a cohesive facade responsibility separately under the migration playbook. |
| Cache maintainer: `cache.py` | 1782 / 1783 physical lines | Schema constant/comment changes only; cache ownership and migration ordering stay intact. No responsibility extraction is needed for this epoch update. |
| Export/Qt integration test maintainers: `tests/test_export.py` | 1377 / 1377 physical lines | INC-QML-16 adds listener registration to the existing inspector harness without dispatch, camera math, swallowed errors or changed inspector assertions. New behavior stays in the focused navigation suite. Exit through coordinated upstream inspector-harness extraction that preserves production-script assertions. |

New handwritten constructor/source-link/viewer modules and tests must remain
below 300 lines. Verification measurements and any remaining platform/system
gaps belong to VALIDATION.md and tests/TRACEABILITY.md.

## Metadata membership projection (INC-QML-14)

Status: **Locally complete; Verified within the bounded static source profile**.
QtProjectIndex resolves accepted
source/resource literals for module/load/access lookup. The additional projection
reuses those accepted facts and canonical endpoints rather than reading a declared
path or evaluating a build condition. Functioning lookup and truthful internal
community counts do not establish this new acceptance evidence.
Architecture decision [D15](ARCHITECTURE.md#d15--project-membership-is-independent-of-component-use)
separates membership from component use and Qt runtime behavior.

`qt_project_membership.resolve_project_memberships(results, nodes, edges, *, root,
project_index, fresh_ast_ids=())` owns the derived joins after canonical source
identities exist. It returns `(derived_nodes, derived_edges)` and replaces only
its own scratch/per-file site mechanisms; borrowed declaration/context dictionaries
remain immutable. The pipeline publishes through starting node identities and
edge-object identities, explicitly including fresh same-ID membership replacements.
Replacing a borrowed site cannot shift append offsets or publish unrelated context.
The admission comparison resolves each already supplied input against the
canonical root, so short paths and parent-directory aliases cannot reject the
same contained file. This identity check does not rewrite lexical source facts,
literal lookup values or the shared `source_path` helper. Foreign input and
declaration/input conflicts still fail the owning metadata guard. Resolving path
identity reads filesystem path metadata, not target source content or new corpus
inputs. The INC-QML-39 checkpoint retains policy 18/schema 12; INC-QML-40 advances
derived policy 19 without changing the AST schema.
The helper and its focused test
module stay below 300 physical lines. Reader syntax, corpus admission, existing
indexes and graph persistence remain in their existing owners.

Each declaration owns an independent `metadata.qml` contract-version-1
`membership_resolution` site. Its bounded fields include `declaration_id`,
`declaration_kind`, original `span`, `source_kind`, `module_key`, resource alias or
logical URL context, `status`, `reason`, `evidence` and `candidates`. Evidence and
candidates each retain at most 50 IDs. A resolved site also records `target_id`.
Site identity is deterministic for the same accepted declaration/input and does
not depend on an absolute checkout path. It retains the declaration's source
provenance without changing the raw declaration's metadata.

| Logical edge | Relation / context / confidence | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Declaration to membership site | `contains` / `qt_membership_site` / `EXTRACTED` | The accepted declaration owns this observed membership attempt |
| Resolved build-source site to file/component | `references` / `qt_project_source` / `EXTRACTED` | Supported literal source membership establishes a unique accepted canonical endpoint |
| Resolved resource-alias site to file/component | `references` / `qt_resource_membership` / `EXTRACTED` | Supported literal alias/path evidence establishes a unique accepted canonical endpoint |

Separate sites prevent repeated declarations and parallel source/resource
mechanisms from collapsing in the existing graph representation. Preserve typed
logical endpoints and original source locations through default-undirected and
directed build/JSON transport. A published source reference establishes static
membership, not a runtime import, QObject relationship or architectural module.

Missing, duplicate, conditional, generated or out-of-root targets retain explicit
unresolved/unsupported site status and bounded reason/evidence without a target
edge. The helper does not open a file, expand the corpus, run a build/QML/plugin,
or choose by filename label. Existing module/resource/loader lookup results are
unchanged. Ordinary coverage follows `QML-RESOLVE-001` semantics; invalid transport
or an unexpected join failure propagates into the existing
`QML_RESOLUTION_FAILED` publication guard rather than adding a second writer.

Qt policy epoch is 6; AST cache schema remains 7. Refresh derives new
membership sites from accepted inputs at the same package version and retires
stale target edges after source/resource edits or removal. Existing publication
ordering retains graph/manifest/root/Qt state on genuine failure even under force;
corrected retry and no-change repeat use the normal lifecycle. These migration,
production consumer and reviewed installed-artifact outcomes pass locally; exact
evidence is recorded in [validation](VALIDATION.md#inc-qml-14-membership-projection)
and [traceability](../../tests/TRACEABILITY.md#project-membership-projection).
The helper/source-test/pipeline/lifecycle-test owners are 187/283/85/267 physical
lines, respectively, all below the 300-line handwritten-file ceiling. Prior
policy-5/schema-7 proof remains historical for INC-QML-12/13. No browser, new
hosted, other-platform or executable Qt evidence is inferred from local tests.

## Exact overload identity (INC-QML-15)

The generic producer owns versioned constructor signatures before node collapse.
`cpp_constructor_signature` canonicalizes the admitted AST parameter shape and
limits signatures to 64 parameters and 360 UTF-8 bytes (480 encoded bytes).
Builtin, self-class and literal QObject types are supported; named aliases,
templates/dependent types, function pointers, arrays, variadics and conditional
syntax retain occurrence identity without exact join authority. Value-only CV,
parameter names/defaults and builtin synonyms normalize; pointer/reference
shape and pointee CV remain significant. Adding/removing another overload never
changes an accepted constructor ID.

`cpp_constructor_binding` joins one unique complete class, one exact declaration
and one definition, preserving original byte spans and definition-file/location.
Duplicate same signatures/bodies, corrupt transported facts and incompatible
owners reject native class authority. Inline and out-of-line Qt mapping selects
the exact accepted signature and occurrence span. A delegating initializer does
not supply an inferred constructor-call target.

The direct producer stamps bounded `cpp_constructor_types` on its source file:
literal include delimiters/paths and namespace/class QObject shadows with original
spans and source size. The corpus validator walks only admitted quoted dependencies
(maximum 128 files, 50 entries per list); missing/corrupt/ambiguous proof rejects
SDK signature authority. Potential local angle-include candidates also reject;
configured compiler include search is not guessed. Existing `_signature` remains
the ordinary-member compatibility normalizer used by `cpp_member_identity`;
constructor identity uses the new exact owner. No second mutable cache or parser
owner is introduced.

[D20](ARCHITECTURE.md#d20--constructor-signatures-authorize-identity-and-joins)
defines schema 10/policy 14 migration. Real manual/watch signature edits/removal,
C++-only mismatch and header repair, original BOM/CRLF/Unicode spans, reload/query/
affected, malformed source and actual read-only/late OS publication failure with
retry have dedicated regression coverage. Installed integration remains pending.

## Semantic correction acceptance matrix (INC-QML-17–20)

Status: implementation and local revalidation in progress. These corrections
retain the existing extraction, scratch-join and publication owners. No corpus
code, build hook, QML engine or plugin executes. Receiver members belong to the
receiving object and accepted type; source construction and search depth constrain
child lookup. Engine/provider joins require declaration identity. Native aliases
require lexical declaration authority. Literal loaders share accepted project
component resolution without making runtime execution claims.

| Increment / acceptance | Positive boundary | Rejection and failure boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| INC-QML-17 / REQ-QML-017-AC02/AC04 | Own/inherited members, receiver-relative recursive/direct children, exact byte spans | Root lexical fallback, siblings, duplicates, dynamic options and unsupported/reparented trees cannot supply a target |
| INC-QML-18 / REQ-QML-017-AC03/AC04 | One exact source engine/component declaration and typed provider | Disjoint/nested names, reassignment, conditional exposure, aliases and unknown lifetime cannot establish shared identity |
| INC-QML-19 / REQ-QML-008-AC01/AC03; REQ-QML-016-AC01–AC04 | Direct native types and proved literal aliases retain canonical endpoints and distinct event mechanisms | Shadowed globals, cycles, conflicts, unsupported aliases and incompatible endpoint roles cannot satisfy a join |
| INC-QML-20 / REQ-QML-017-AC01/AC04 | Literal engine URL constructor and component loadUrl/create retain component/root provenance | Computed URLs, unsupported overloads, duplicate/reassigned loaders and unavailable resources remain uncertain |

Each correction requires raw JSON direction, query/affected, cold/warm and actual
manual/watch edit/removal parity. Policy upgrades must reanalyze unchanged inputs;
actual parse, join or publication failure must retain prior durable products and
allow corrected retry. Existing atomic publication and diagnostics are authoritative;
these helpers introduce no new persistence boundary. Reviewed wheel and full
contribution checks are final local gates. Native Qt/browser/platform, hosted
publication and broader API-family proof remain distinct evidence gaps.

## Temporary middle-button camera navigation (INC-QML-16)

Status: **Locally verified at emitted-script and reviewed installed-artifact
boundaries** under REQ-QML-021-AC01–AC03 and changed REQ-QML-019-AC04. Native
browser/device and other-platform behavior remains unverified.
[D16](ARCHITECTURE.md#d16--middle-button-input-owns-only-the-temporary-camera)
assigns mouse middle-button movement to the camera without changing source facts,
node geometry, physics, selection or filters. The Overview control/function/state
and top-ten ranking are removed. Checked full startup, community aggregation,
Select All/None, filters, search and the inspector retain their current roles.

`exporters/html_navigation.py::MIDDLE_PAN_SCRIPT` is a plain JavaScript IIFE using
the existing `container` and `network`, injected once after network construction
and initial physics setup. It has no package, SDK or DOM dependency beyond the
existing viewer. For each active mouse movement, obtain `network.getViewPosition()`
and `network.getScale()`, then call `network.moveTo` with position
`(view.x - dx/scale, view.y - dy/scale)`, unchanged current scale and
`animation: false`. The screen delta is incremental. Reading the scale at each
movement preserves a native wheel zoom that occurs between movements; no wheel
listener or zoom-policy override is added.

Only mouse middle-button pointer input with a held middle-button mask and a
nonnegative integer pointer identity starts the gesture. Guarded container
pointer capture plus window move/up/cancel listeners keep outside-container
movement and capture-failure fallback bounded. Matching release/cancel, lost
middle-button state, lost capture, window blur or page hide ends the gesture.
Pointer coordinates and view coordinates must be finite, scale positive, and the
derived world position finite; invalid camera/API state safely aborts rather than
accumulating a jump. Cleanup restores cursor/user-selection state before optional
capture release. Middle mousedown/auxclick and active text selection are suppressed
to prevent native autoscroll/selection; left/right/touch and wheel behavior are
otherwise retained.

The helper writes only temporary camera/input state. It neither calls node-move/
selection/filter/physics APIs nor writes datasets, RAW metadata, graph JSON,
sidecars, local storage or saved preferences. Camera/capture failure ends or safely
falls back from the gesture; it adds no parser diagnostic, persistence operation
or graph-write bypass. Qt policy 6, AST schema 7 and source fact contracts remain
unchanged. The helper and focused public tests stay below 300 physical lines;
HTML integration measures 789 lines within its existing 810-line legacy ceiling.
The helper/initial-view/middle-pan modules measure 116/245/223 physical lines;
each remains below 300. The inspector-harness compatibility adjustment retains
its own documented 1377-line legacy test ceiling.

Production emitted-script tests pass source/aggregate pan math at normal and
changed zoom, autoscroll prevention, release/invalid-state paths, input/wheel
coexistence, retained controls and immutable payloads. The 60-case focused suite
includes 24 independent horizontal/vertical/diagonal, scale and view variants.
Existing Overview expectations are superseded, not evidence for changed AC04.
Reviewed source/wheel/isolated-install equality covers all 156 Python payloads;
installed viewer scripts retain canonical/RAW facts, checked startup, source
inspectors and clean release/blur/retry camera behavior. Current exact outcomes
belong to traceability/validation. No native browser visual/device, new hosted or
other-platform result is claimed.

## Declaration identity and provider lifetime (INC-QML-18)

`CppDeclarationIdentity` is an immutable per-accepted-file syntax index. Source
path, original declaration span and enclosing lexical scopes own a portable
SHA256 identity. The index accepts bounded local/parameter/auto declarations and
accepted `this` owners; duplicate declarations, writes, deferred/conditional
ownership and computed/member/factory expressions retain rejection reasons.
Display names never replace an absent identity.

The access collector carries receiver/assigned/engine/provider identities and
provider lexical end offsets. Loads and handles use source-owner plus declaration
identity keys. Context exposure requires one load of that engine/component and
a provider whose lexical lifetime contains the load. Event collectors transport
both native endpoint declaration IDs; the cross-language adapter selects the
correct endpoint before resolving its QML handle. Mutable loads/handles remain
owned by one analysis-run access index; source facts belong to their producer.

Original spans, graph IDs and graph persistence ownership remain unchanged.
Policy 8 refreshes prior Qt overlays; AST schema 7 stays compatible. Parse/join/
write failure retention follows existing publication owners. Native execution,
factory/member identities and runtime object lifetime are outside this profile.
The continuing construction review rejects unproven/widget QObject ancestry
without changing native member visibility. Both seams are source-authority checks
under D17 and the existing acceptance IDs.

## Lexical native types and construction ancestry (INC-QML-19)

`NativeTypeScope` owns an immutable accepted-file type index. Local, class and
namespace scopes, declaration order, simple using/typedef chains and namespace
aliases resolve literal class spellings against accepted complete definitions.
Unknown, duplicate, conditional, cyclic, unsupported or later declarations block
outer lookup instead of lending a global class identity. Parameters use their
declaration position; local variables and member pointers use their owning source
positions. Emission, connect/disconnect and registrations share this authority.

`type_alias` and literal `type_include` facts preserve original source ownership.
`IncludedAliasShadows` walks only accepted explicit header paths, with a 128-header
bound; it validates provenance and blocks outer fallback for unavailable imported
aliases. It reads no new includes and does not execute preprocessing. Positive
cross-file alias target resolution, using-namespace directives, templates and SDK
type discovery remain excluded. Cold/full and fresh-header borrowed-context paths
publish the same source-owned facts without mutating borrowed nodes.

The native class producer adds canonical base names/status using the same lexical
type index. Construction lookup requires complete accepted source/class identity,
matching original spans and proven non-widget QObject ancestry; unknown external
bases, widget subclasses, local QObject shadows or corrupted proof cannot supply
parenting. Native member visibility remains an independent contract. The supported
findChild QObject* filter also requires unshadowed SDK type identity.

Policy 9 refreshes old derived overlays; AST schema 7 is unchanged. Alias facts
are additive and graph persistence remains owned by existing manual/watch writers.
The class, alias, variable, event and registration collectors each remain under
300 physical lines. No compiler, Qt SDK or corpus execution is introduced.

## Literal loaders and component engine ownership (INC-QML-20)

`qt_cpp_loaders` owns bounded literal URL and direct-constructor admission.
The access collector passes source-position type/declaration indexes, then
publishes original-byte qml_load facts. Only exact unshadowed supported SDK
types authorize special loading/root semantics. Parent-only engine/component
constructors are not loads. A component's engine-only constructor records an
association keyed by component declaration identity; later loadUrl uses that
exact engine for root/context-provider joins. Assignment, conditional creation,
factory results or unknown engine identity supply no guessed binding.

Supported URL/mode/creation overloads are checked independently of literal text.
QUrl wrappers need accepted SDK identity, including rejection of same-spelled
callables. Absolute literal fromLocalFile input becomes a file URI; resource,
relative, computed or nested forms remain unavailable. QString colon-resource
convenience paths and QUrl validation have different semantics. Explicit global
SDK names can bypass a namespace shadow, but cannot bypass a source-defined
global class. No URL or analyzed engine is evaluated. Qt 6.8
[engine](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qqmlapplicationengine.html),
[component](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qqmlcomponent.html) and
[fromLocalFile](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qurl.html#fromLocalFile) contracts define
the bounded profile; they do not establish general overload/runtime equivalence.

The existing access index resolves accepted resources/modules, and the resolver
requires one supported source loader before admitting a created/root handle.
Producer facts remain file-owned, association/type indexes unit-owned, and
manual/watch persistence caller-owned. Policy 10 refreshes derived Qt overlays;
AST schema 7 is unchanged. loadData/setData, staged creation, arbitrary SDK
subclasses and dynamic contexts remain outside this increment.

The acceptance matrix covers literal provenance, provider identity, false SDK
authority, real source/resource/member edits and removal, full/cold/warm/manual/
watch parity, persisted/query/affected orientation, parse/replace failure retention
and repaired retry/idempotency. Existing diagnostic expectations now assert the
precise declaration-identity reason; no target/retention assertion is weakened.

| Legacy touched owner/file | Current size / permitted ceiling | Rationale and exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language-fixture maintainer: `tests/test_languages.py` | 5117 / 5120 physical lines | One QML facade/original-span case follows CONTRIBUTING's language admission convention. Existing multi-language ownership is preserved. Extract per-language fixtures through a separate characterized change that keeps discovery and unrelated-language contracts. |

Every new handwritten loader/probe/test module remains below 300 physical lines.
At the INC-QML-20 checkpoint the unchanged atomic writer's read-only Windows
failure remained INC-QML-23. Later individual/cohort corrections below supersede
that disposition; forced replacement-failure tests remain narrower evidence.

## Follow-up correction acceptance matrix (INC-QML-21–27)

| Increment | Success and boundary/rejection | Failure and retained state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| INC-QML-21 | Exact global/namespaced/nested owners and header/source members survive raw-call remapping and export; missing, corrupted, later, duplicate, CV/ref-mismatched or over-limit using authority cannot bind by basename | Actual manual/watch edits and original-byte proof; common publication failure/retry contracts apply |
| INC-QML-22 | Unshadowed static reflection and handle forms target receiver-owned members; alias/class/forward/conditional SDK-name shadows and invalid receiver/lifetime evidence create no target | Original spans, query/affected and strict whole-graph manual/watch parity; parse/write failures preserve all four accepted products |
| INC-QML-23 | Writable destinations and bounded OS fallbacks preserve the individual writer contract; read-only and directory destinations reject before displacement | Landing/source-cleanup/backup-cleanup faults restore prior bytes; a second restore fault retains explicit recovery evidence |
| INC-QML-24 | Literal SDK loaders retain source provenance and global qualification; incomplete SDK-name source declarations cannot authorize engines, wrappers or roots; conditional/reassigned identity remains uncertain | SDK→forward→SDK→removed manual/watch parity, parse/publication retention, repaired retry and repeat |
| INC-QML-25 | Prepared graph/root/manifest/Qt-state and optional clustered products form one accepted cohort; unchanged bytes skip replacement; duplicate targets and detected concurrent change reject | Actual read-only products, staging/late replace faults and ordinary/non-OS restoration failures retain or explicitly report recoverable disk copies; first-build failure accepts no products |
| INC-QML-26 | Only absent fresh, unreferenced source-less AST placeholders are pruned after a complete successful Qt refresh; live edges/hyperedges, semantic/native/source-owned facts survive | Partial/failed refresh grants no prune authority; common publication failure/retry contract protects the resulting graph |
| INC-QML-27 | Accepted property/provider NOTIFY authority creates real canonical subscriptions for direct/Connections handlers; explicit formals and legacy injected parameters have separate scope | Invalid/CONSTANT/unavailable/ambiguous notify evidence creates no edge; real source/metadata/QML edits and guarded publication prove removal/recovery |

Successful source resolution has no new operational warning. Static rejection
retains source status/reason; actual parser/join/write failures use their owning
diagnostic contract. Native execution and process/power-loss simulation are not
performed because the runtime analyzes source and promises exception recovery only.
Other-platform/native system evidence remains explicitly unexecuted.

### Producer and API authority

`CppIdentity`, class proof and member canonicalization own qualified C++ metadata
before deduplication. Exact UTF-8 spelling is transported separately from bounded
display text. Unique source body/signature and accepted containment evidence are
required; over-limit namespace authority is rejected rather than truncated into
a resolved target. Full source/AST/member direction remains consistent.

`NativeTypeScope.sdk_type` distinguishes external SDK spelling from any visible
source declaration. `CppDeclarationIdentity.type_binding` retains declared type
spelling/position independently of runtime identity. Reassignment can preserve an
observed SDK loader fact while preventing its target join. Explicit global syntax
bypasses a namespace shadow, not a source-defined global SDK-name class. Runtime
factory/member expressions and unsupported aliases remain unavailable. Accepted
literal includes carry generic class declarations as SDK shadows separately from
opaque alias targets. Included forwards, transitive paths, source order and the
128-header walk bound grant no new corpus discovery or native provider admission.

`QtMemberViews.property_notify` follows the accepted property's real NOTIFY
accessor, requiring its provider, signal role and source proof. It does not invent
a native propertyChanged declaration. QML handler facts carry `implicit_parameters`:
legacy blocks alone receive injected names; function/arrow formals own bindings.
Final AST schema 9 and Qt policy 12 invalidate stale unchanged-input facts. IDs,
original spans and graph projection remain governed by the existing contracts.

### Publication and cleanup

The watch/update owner uses `ProductPublication` to snapshot old products, prepare
candidate serializer output and commit replacements. Source cache ownership is
independent. The Qt state writer receives a stage directory; its candidate is
accepted only with the cohort. Successful cleanup failure warns without reporting
the coherent accepted update as failed. Unsuccessful rollback retains snapshots.

Partial-setup cleanup regression coverage injects failure through `Path.unlink`,
the actual production boundary, and delegates real removal for unrelated owned
copies. Python 3.10 caches the underlying `os.unlink` accessor, so patching only
the later module function does not exercise that cleanup failure. INC-QML-48
corrects the test seam and records the rejected owned target while retaining
diagnostic redaction, unchanged accepted products and durable recovery assertions.
The transaction implementation and public failure contract remain unchanged.

After complete Qt extraction/reconciliation, `prune_stale_ast_orphans` receives
fresh identities and reference ownership. Partial/failed extraction cannot prune.
It preserves source-backed, native/semantic, callable and live edge/hyperedge facts,
and never mutates borrowed dictionary inputs. Non-Qt legacy reconciliation remains
under its existing owner.

| Touched legacy owner/file | Measured size / ceiling | Cohesion rationale and extraction exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic extractor maintainer: `extractors/engine.py` | 7720 / 7730 physical lines | Narrow producer identity integration within the existing dispatcher; extract C++ ownership separately after characterization under the migration playbook. |
| Generic resolver maintainer: `extractors/resolution.py` | 3981 / 4000 | One guarded class/member canonicalization seam; move that responsibility in a separate characterized increment. |
| Shared writer maintainer: `paths.py` | 577 / 600 | Preserve one OS replace/rollback owner; separate a cohesive writer extraction after failure/ordering characterization. |
| Update maintainer: `watch.py` | 2487 / 2550 | Cohort integration replaces existing duplicated writes and shrinks the file; separate publication orchestration only after compatibility characterization. |
| Extractor facade maintainer: `extract.py` | 9009 / 9010 physical lines | One existing canonicalization call supplies raw calls to the same resolver owner; preserve dispatcher direction and extract a cohesive facade responsibility separately under the migration playbook. |
| Cache maintainer: `cache.py` | 1782 / 1783 | Existing schema seam only; retain the previously documented cache extraction boundary. |

New helper and test files remain under 300 physical lines. Existing extractor
facade ownership and dependency direction remain unchanged; children do not import
`graphify.extract`. Plan review distinguishes corrected cases from open wider
adoption, inherited-signal and overload support.

## Explicit emission source authority (INC-QML-28)

The shared call scanner keeps its default name inventory unchanged. Its explicit
opt-in admits only source annotations proved against standalone executable AST
call ranges and offset-preserving masked bytes. A preceding local define/undef
blocks annotation authority without preprocessing. Observed explicit sites remain
owned by their actual callable/file even when no signal declaration is available;
the resolver alone supplies accepted canonical targets.

Event dispatch honors explicit emission before connect/disconnect spelling. It
does not recover rejected annotation authority from a nearby text prefix. A
computed receiver's terminal call keeps the full outer AST range and unavailable
receiver identity; an inner factory sharing its start cannot become an unknown
bare signal. Known bare signal calls retain their separate inventory contract.
This changes derived event admission only: Qt policy 15, AST schema 10 unchanged.
Existing publication and diagnostic owners retain failure/retry ordering.

## Project and header adoption (INC-QML-08a)

`extractors/qml_qmake_values` owns original-position lexical statement coverage and
literal paths; `qml_qmake` owns resulting module/source facts. Exact `$$PWD`
prefixes use the parsed file's directory. Only `=` and `+=` are admitted. Paths
are bounded to 384 UTF-8 bytes and scopes to 64 levels. Unrelated toolchain
settings do not reject module facts; relevant conditions, unknown evaluation,
PWD reassignment, expansion and root escapes do. `qt_qmake_assignment` is observed
lexical evidence; `qt_qmake_statement` records ignored/unresolved coverage.
Neither expands corpus discovery or supplies independent lookup authority.
QML_IMPORT_PATH tooling hints and QMLPATHS build hints remain distinct from
explicit analysis roots.

`cpp_header` owns the existing bounded 256 KiB classification prefix. It masks
comments, continued comments, normal/raw strings and characters before testing
visible C++ markers. The facade retains discovery and Objective-C priority.
Whitespace, BOM, CRLF and Unicode retain their original-byte meaning; plain C and
inconclusive headers retain C dispatch. Classification requires no optional Qt
parser or project execution. AST schema 11 and Qt policy 16 invalidate old source
and derived facts at unchanged package versions. Root boundaries and persistence
ordering are unchanged; normal retry reparses corrected metadata/source.

## Declared provider and child-service APIs (INC-QML-08b)

`qt_cpp_api_shape` preserves CV, indirection and member operators.
`qt_cpp_api_types` records declaration-position targets for returns, public fields
and properties. `CppDeclarationIdentity.declared_type_binding` retains root
spelling without changing older normalized callers. The access collector carries
exact root identity and at most eight literal call/field steps. One object pointer
or lvalue reference supplies an API hop; root values/references require dot access,
pointers arrow access. Direct address-of and implicit this retain source proof.
Unsupported shapes, cycles, conditions, duplicate members or missing canonical
callables grant no target. Helpers do not reread source, evaluate getters or own
persistence.

`DeclaredProviderIndex` validates borrowed canonical class/member/type evidence.
`qt_context_paths` follows accepted child-property/accessor chains and independently
checks serialized endpoints. Member facts require the actual generic callable
role and original class/member span; property READ accessors require exact owner,
file, annotation span/name and zero arity. NOTIFY consumers repeat the producer's
real property/signal/accessor proof. Canonical target existence alone supplies no
authority. Type evidence stays distinct from bounded display values.

`qt_context_subscriptions` projects source-owned Connections and literal
signal.connect callbacks after provider resolution. A `context_handler_endpoint`
separates inverse contains/reference pairs. Native implicit handler binders precede
nested callback/provider lookup; explicit function/arrow formals and nearer local
JavaScript declarations retain their lexical authority. Notifications follow the
real NOTIFY signal. Cold/warm and manual/watch production updates rederive the
complete overlay after relevant C++, QML or metadata changes. D21 records the
static API/runtime identity distinction; final epochs and installed proof belong
to validation.

`qt_qml_callback_proof` independently validates the original call, callback,
component/object scope, owner and source spans. Connections endpoints must be the
actual source handler. Literal signal.connect callbacks use the existing QML
index; captured local JavaScript binders retain precedence. A sibling function's
existing ID cannot replace that source correspondence after serialization.

## Logical dependency direction (INC-QML-30)

`graph_direction.logical_endpoints` validates the complete stored endpoint pair.
Both absent markers retain legacy orientation; one absent, foreign, wrong-type or
contradictory directed marker rejects the edge. Complete undirected markers may
reverse physical insertion order. Exact endpoint types prevent boolean/integer
identity coercion. The validator reads metadata without changing the graph.

`affected.affected_nodes` builds one accepted incoming index for undirected
graphs; directed graphs retain native adjacency. The same validator governs
outward class/member seeding and `qt_affected.owned_ancestors` source promotion.
Depth, relation filters and source-site provenance keep their existing contracts.
`paths.load_node_link_graph` restores typed direction only when both markers are
absent; explicit corrupt transport remains visible for consumer rejection.
This consumer correction changes neither source facts nor cache epochs. Existing
publication owners and failure/recovery ordering remain unchanged.

## JSON direction rejection (INC-QML-31)

`export.to_json` validates every physical/logical pair before consuming private
markers or writing. Native directed graphs require the same directed pair;
undirected graphs permit its complete accepted reversal. Partial, foreign or
ill-typed markers return failure with QT_EXPORT_DIRECTION before the destination
is touched, including under force. Serialization leaves the input graph unchanged.

`qt_export.logical_endpoints` delegates to the shared pair validator and preserves
its existing bounded ValueError contract. External database/Cypher exports retain
the established complete logical-marker interpretation for bidirectional storage
wrappers; they still reject partial, foreign and ill-typed pairs before connection
or file output. That external interpretation does not authorize contradictory
native-directed JSON. Existing coordinated publication stages restore the prior
product cohort on serializer rejection; repaired retry and repeated publication
use the normal path. No source facts, policy epoch or writer ownership changes.

## Initial raw-update comparison (INC-QML-32)

`watch._canonical_graph_for_compare` retains comparison ownership. It normalizes
only missing-versus-empty diagnostics, failed-source, QML/Qt-failure and hyperedge
lists. Nonempty lists and wrong-type values still differ. The extraction-run
`extracted_sources` list is transient comparison provenance; authoritative source
facts remain compared in their nodes/edges. Unknown metadata remains observable.
The function copies its input and owns no mutable run/cache/persistence state.

The first accepted raw graph survives an unchanged second manual/watch update
without a byte or mtime rewrite. Genuine source edits and existing publication
failure/recovery still use the owning writer and cohort stages. Clustered topology
comparison is a separate contract. This correction adds no schema/policy epoch.

## Shared generic C++ file-role proof (INC-QML-33)

Previously, membership and source containment each required an empty generic
file metadata record. The constructor producer now retains bounded include/shadow
proof on that canonical node. `qt_source_file_role.generic_file_role` owns the
shared predicate: exact AST/fresh origin, source label/location and non-callable
file role, followed by the exact accepted constructor transport. Each caller
still owns normalized source paths and unique endpoint selection.

`cpp_constructor_type_authority.valid_source_transport` extracts the existing
immutable transport checks after their characterization. Inputs are accepted
dictionaries; output is a boolean. The predicate reads no source, stores no state,
and owns no cache or persistence. Constructor authority still requires a complete
record separately. An incomplete valid file can contain source sites without
becoming a constructor or SDK type proof. Consumers import this focused validator;
extractor children do not import the extractor facade. File IDs, fact ownership,
join ordering, graph writers and cache epochs remain unchanged. Foreign,
duplicate, semantic or malformed nodes cannot borrow file identity.

## Candidate direction preflight (INC-QML-34)

`graph_direction.valid_direction_pairs` consumes explicit edge tuples and their
native directed flag through the established logical-pair validator. Watch owns
the bounded failure diagnostic and invokes it before raw comparison/publication
and before clustered topology comparison. Neither an equal topology nor force
can authorize a partial, foreign, ill-typed or contradictory candidate. The
validator does not mutate candidates, publish data or accept analysis checkpoints.
Existing cohort/cache retention and repaired retry remain with their original
owners. External database wrapper interpretation remains separately documented.

## Exact prior import ownership and external cleanup (INC-QML-35)

The reconciliation caller captures `prior_import_ids` from the original persisted
graph before any origin inference. `qt_orphan_cleanup.previous_import_targets`
uses the builder's supplied canonical import family, exact source-owned AST
import/context/confidence, valid direction and unique owner/target identity.
An inferred or backfilled AST origin cannot grant historical ownership.

The pure cleanup owner retires only accepted prior import endpoints matching the
generated external shape, absent from fresh output and every surviving ordinary
or hyperedge reference, during a complete successful Qt refresh. Missing/semantic
origin is the legacy external shape; foreign/AST origin, source/location,
metadata presence, callable roles, wrong type/label and unrelated IDs block
retirement. View attributes do not invent source ownership. Borrowed inputs,
source-backed facts and still-referenced nodes remain unchanged. The caller owns
the per-run proof set, extraction, reconciliation and publication; the helper
reads no source, executes nothing and owns no cache or persistent state.

## Relationship mechanism authority (INC-QML-36)

The Qt/QML projection repeats original occurrence ownership, file/location/span,
status, lexical admission and native endpoint roles. It accepts the exact
operation-to-relation/context mapping, including reads, calls, aliases, signal
emissions, subscriptions, loads and reverse reflection. Complete endpoint IDs
cannot repair an altered operation, flow, endpoint role or borrowed occurrence.
The builder selects existing typed bridge producers independently of their
relation/context/confidence and validates before its generic relation branch;
`uses` cannot bypass proof. Context-binding ownership/exposure remains with its
separate contract. Generic language relationships remain unchanged.

## Per-occurrence event annotation (INC-QML-37)

`resolve_qml_event_access` retains fresh-result mutation ownership. Each accepted
site creates a local node/edge collection before adding it to the run's aggregate.
`update_qt` rebuilds bounded literal transport without recursively transporting
`raw_values`. Canonical source-owned role nodes and same-occurrence partial native
edges receive the final bridge annotation, so deduplication cannot preserve the
older incomplete context. IDs, original spans and independent occurrences survive.
The event resolver reads accepted facts only; source/graph/cache publication
owners and runtime exclusions are unchanged. Qt policy 18 triggers same-package
derived refresh. These corrections implement the existing source-authority and
publication decisions D17/D19; no competing ownership or runtime is introduced.

## First raw external-stub publication (INC-QML-38)

The canonical builder mint remains append-only. The updater records the node-list
length immediately before minting and stamps only its newly appended placeholders
with the established semantic origin. Existing/source-backed/AST/manual/semantic
nodes retain their own fields and origin. Subsequent legacy provenance inference
remains compatible, and comparison continues to observe origins rather than
discarding them. Writer/cohort/checkpoint ordering remains unchanged. This is
publication-created placeholder state, with no source parser/cache schema change.

## Canonical input and diagnostic boundaries (INC-QML-40/41)

The reproduced facade gap is owned by the existing cached absolute-source-file
normalization in `extract.py`. The correction resolves each supplied
physical identity before its contained/external decision and reuses that value
for endpoint-key forms. Source content, original byte spans, literal fact values,
external-file policy and native traversal validation retain their owners.
This is a shared normalization correction, so generic/Python and true external
controls accompany Qt/QML success and lifecycle regressions. No separate path
registry or new mutable root is introduced. Per-file caches contain facts before
facade normalization, so warm replay can repair provenance without changing AST
schema 12. Qt policy 19 is the approved same-package refresh for prior policy-18
native/Qt products, including no-change updates. Existing stamp inspection,
cohort publication, retention and repair ordering remain authoritative.
Generic-only older API outputs require an explicit forced rebuild for repair.

The current facade measures 8,997 physical lines, from 8,993 before INC-QML-40;
the earlier tables record their historical 9,009-line snapshot. The existing
9,010-line ceiling, extractor-facade maintainer ownership and separate characterized
facade extraction exit remain in force. This correction adds four net lines to
the existing cached responsibility and does not mix a mechanical extractor port
or unrelated split into the behavior fix.

The corrected diagnostic escape is owned by `qt_qml_pipeline`'s existing join
failure handler. `_diagnostic_source` guards physical identity lookup and falls
back to existing lexical `source_path` containment. It retains the complete safe
relative label up to 160 characters; outside/unavailable, overlong, C0/C1/DEL and
Unicode line/paragraph-separator labels become the empty `source_file` string,
without truncation. This diagnostic-only fallback annotates every affected source with the existing failure
code and does not lend lookup/endpoint authority. CLI/watch still reject before
normal graph-product publication; prior products and recovery retain existing
cohort ownership. OSError/RuntimeError probes distinguish complete diagnostics
from the already passing retention/recovery controls. INC-QML-40/41 have local
source and fresh installed proof; current hosted acceptance remains pending.

## Walked source identity (INC-QML-42)

The facade owns per-run admission, `_walked_rel`, realpath memoization and remap
publication. The 31-line `source_identity` helper owns relative-name selection
only. Inputs are absolute source/root paths, the physical source and an explicit
cached-realpath callback/CWD; output is the accepted root-relative walked name
or a containment ValueError. It stores no state, reads no content and imports
no extractor facade. Physical containment precedes written root-relative names,
then a lexical ancestor identifying the scan root, then the physical fallback.
Unavailable parent anchors are skipped without exposing their backend body.

Primary file, symbol-prefix, stem/target decomposition and final source_file/
definition_file normalization share that decision. Root-relative keys preserve
two discovered source owners of the same target, including cache replay and
aliased scan roots, without lending external/native authority. Existing producer
IDs and topology, original bytes/spans, syntax-cache fragments and graph-product
cohort ordering retain ownership. The facade measures 8,998 physical lines,
within its existing 9,010 ceiling; the focused regression file is 277 lines.
This is a characterized normalization correction, not an extractor migration.

Policy 20 triggers no-edit native/Qt refresh of older policy-19 products with
schema 12 unchanged. Failure retains the complete prior cohort and corrected
retry/repeat completes; generic-only old products require full/forced rebuilding.
The separately reproduced co-owner watch-invalidation and NTFS short-leaf
spelling boundaries are INC-QML-44/45; this checkpoint does not claim them fixed.

## Physical co-owner watch invalidation (INC-QML-44)

The watch selector owns detection, exclusions, semantic-document separation,
deletion handling and the existing publication cohort. Its new stateless
`watch_coowners` boundary receives positive changed paths and already accepted
nonsemantic inputs. Within one call, it groups verified contained regular files
by nonzero device/inode identity; a canonical contained path is the conservative
fallback where usable inode IDs are absent. Hardlinks join only with actual
inode evidence. No content is read, source discovered or durable cache introduced.
The selector keeps notification order and appends additional owners in corpus
order; order cannot determine source-ID ownership or hide a remap collision.

Unexpected resolution/stat failure, disappearance after admission, foreign or
nonregular identity rejects with `WATCH_SOURCE_IDENTITY_FAILED`. Its existing
watch exception boundary reports failure and retains graph, manifest, analysis
root and Qt stamp. Safe quoted root-relative context is bounded to 160 characters;
controls, line separators, unavailable and longer context become an empty field.
Backend exception bodies are omitted. Ordinary absence before discovery keeps
existing deletion behavior. Restore the source and retry through normal detection;
accepted repeat updates preserve product bytes. The error catalog owns the code,
and traceability distinguishes source, installed and hosted evidence.

## Native file-spelling admission and physical ID ownership (INC-QML-45)

The facade normalizes initial input paths before parser checks, worker dispatch
or cache access. `source_identity.normalize_input_source` leaves POSIX and missing/
non-file inputs to existing handling. Existing Windows regular files use bounded
`GetLongPathNameW` output and unchanged physical-target/same-file checks. The
returned long spelling preserves lexical junction/symlink owners; resolving the
entire input would erase those owners. Successful output uses UTF-16 code-unit
bounds, including supplementary Unicode characters. The helper reads identity
metadata only and retains no state, cache, root or content ownership.

Unavailable/malformed/oversized output or changed physical identity rejects with
`SOURCE_INPUT_IDENTITY_FAILED` before worker/cache work. Direct extraction names
the failed stage and repair/retry action without claiming a durable graph exists.
The existing manual/watch owners retain prior products on that rejection. Safe
lexical relative context is JSON-quoted and bounded; unavailable, unsafe or long
context is empty. Missing/non-file inputs preserve their previous downstream
result rather than becoming a new whole-batch identity failure.

`resolved_source_owners` collects explicit walked claims for each physical form
within one analysis run. Primary walked IDs remain separate. A supplied canonical
physical owner wins its shared absolute form; one unique alias keeps the existing
fallback. Several aliases without that physical owner retain the portable
physical endpoint form, with no arbitrary alias choice or newly admitted source
authority. Ordinary unresolved import stubs retain the graph builder's existing
policy; a stub cannot establish a parsed declaration or native endpoint role.
The same ownership applies to suffixed callable entries. Prefix/stem
lookups retain each walked owner. This corrects watch rename order dependence
without sorting the notification list or overwriting another owner's file ID.

Combined Qt policy 21 refreshes older derived products; AST schema 12 and cache/
publication formats remain unchanged. Generic-only historical outputs use an
explicit full/forced rebuild. Acceptance records distinguish the earlier
policy20 checkpoint from the combined source, installed and hosted results.

## Manual directory-link update profile (INC-QML-46)

The update parser accepts `--follow-symlinks` in either position around its one
root argument and forwards the explicit Boolean to `_rebuild_code`. Omission
retains false. The existing rebuild/discovery owner applies ignore rules and
physical containment, selects inputs and publishes the graph/state cohort. A
saved graph or scan-root marker does not persist this traversal permission.
Unknown flags and multiple roots reject with the existing option diagnostics
and exit 2 before rebuild or publication. Accepted failures retain their existing
writer diagnostic, product/cache retention and retry policy; no new error code
or publication boundary is introduced. [D25](ARCHITECTURE.md#d25--manual-directory-link-discovery-is-an-explicit-option)
records the scope decision.

Policy-upgrade fixtures use the explicit profile for older-state setup, manual/
watch updates, failed staging, retry, full comparison and repeat. A separate real
POSIX control retains default exclusion. Native short-parent fixture expectations
under INC-QML-47 require exact long entry spelling after input admission, while
the distinct symlink fixture still requires its exact lexical parser owner.
Neither change relaxes graph, native endpoint, cache or persisted provenance
assertions. Source, installed and hosted outcomes remain revision-bound.
